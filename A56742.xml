            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Limits of a Preface will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the writing the Life of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the following Diſcourſes, neither have I materials by me for ſuch a work. My firſt acquaintance with him was ſometime after his ſettlement in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> I was the more inclined to a Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him, becauſe he had his Education in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> under, and was much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Dr. <hi>H. P.</hi> a perſon never to be nam'd by me, without paying a very particular honour and reſpect to his memory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antoninus</hi> begins his admirable Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life, with an account of his ſeveral Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors, from whom he had learnt this and that piece of uſefull and practical knowledge: inſtead of many, I am obliged to inſtance in this excellent Man alone, to whom I am more indebted, than to all the Teachers I ever had; and I take this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to give publick Thanks to God for the happy opportunities I enjoy'd of his wiſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
<pb facs="tcp:60245:3"/>and Counſels; from him I learnt rightly to underſtand Religion, the Idea's of which had been ſo confounded by falſe Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the notion of it ſet forth in ſo fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a manner, that there is reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it was the ſuperſtition of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which has laid the Foundation of the too viſible Scepticiſm and Infidelity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Age. From him I learnt that the Laws of Religion were intrinſically good, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely for the beneſit and advantage of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Creatures, which is the only true no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, which can ſecure the Faith, and keep up the practice of it among Men, who muſt and ever will be ſway'd by what they are once thoroughly perſwaded is their chief Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and higheſt Benefit. He was a Man of clear thoughts which he always freely communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and of ſo univerſal a Benevolence, and took ſuch delight in doing good, that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the name of <hi>Pamphilus</hi> among his Friends. My acquaintance was never large, and I have ſtaid a little of the longeſt in the World, to outlive moſt of thoſe few Friends I once had; but ſo far as my ſmall experience has reacht, I cannot but ſay, I never knew a better Man, a wiſer Chriſtian, or a truer Friend. The Reader, if he be good natur'd, will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me for ſtepping a little out of my way, to pay a debt of Gratitude. To return to our Author, of whom I have undertaken to give ſome account, from the time of my firſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb facs="tcp:60245:3"/>with him. He had not been long in Town, before he was taken notice of by ſome of the beſt Judges of Learning, who ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned his Abilities, and how fit he was for thoſe undertakings, in which the Service of the Church afterwards required him to engage; I mean in thoſe perillous times, when both our Religion and our Civil Rights were ſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly endanger'd, that many deſpair'd and gave them up for loſt. The Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſtood in this breach, which they maintain'd with that Courage, that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my gave back, and a ſpace was gain'd for our deliverance: The behaviour of the Divines of this Church, will be remember'd by Poſterity, and a Collection of their writings at a time when others were ſo ſilent and complying, will remain a ſtanding Armory againſt Popery, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſhall renew its attempts upon us. Then it was that he ſhow'd both his Courage and his Skill in defending our eſtabliſhed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The former in contemning thoſe nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous threatning Letters, ſome ſent him by the Penny-Poſt, and others thrown over his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Wall; and one night a Divine, of about his bulk, and a Friend of his, coming late tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough <hi>Harrow-Alley</hi> into <hi>Goodman</hi>'s-<hi>fields,</hi> which was his uſual walk home, two Men with drawn Swords came up to him, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him in the face, ſaid the one to the other, <hi>'tis not he,</hi> and ſo went off; which had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effect upon him, but to give him a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:60245:4"/>not to ſtay out in the Evenings. His abilities I need not ſay any thing of, they are ſufficiently ſeen in thoſe Learned Treatiſes pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by him, on this occaſion, The Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Hoſt, the Sacrifice of the Maſs, and that extraordinary diſcourſe in anſwer to the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s Book of Communion in one kind; not to mention his leſſer pieces of the ſixth Note of the Church, and his Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Texts of Scripture produced by the Papiſts for the Celibacy of Prieſts: whoever carefully reads over thoſe Treatiſes will find the ſubject exhauſted, and that he needs not to ſearch any further into thoſe Arguments; and by thoſe conceſſions, ſo Ingeniouſly made to his Adverſaries, which ſhow'd that he ſought Truth only, and not Victory, the poſſibility of a reply ſeems to me to be prevented; and the Learned <hi>French</hi> Prelate, who has ſhow'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have dexterity enough for moſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, would yet I believe be loth to be put upon the uneaſie task of defending his Book againſt that anſwer to it. When the fear of Popery was over, it was the general expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that our little diſputes and controverſies would be thrown up, and to prevent any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture danger, we ſhould be at perfect Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion among our ſelves. The behaviour of the Clergy in circumſtances when they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing but ruin to themſelves and their Families, it was hop'd had removed all the Jealouſies of our Diſſenting Brethren, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb facs="tcp:60245:4"/>them to ſuch a temper, that there ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing wanting to gain the wiſeſt and beſt part of them to our Communion, but to let them be aſſured, that we would receive them kindly; nothing could ſo effectually ſecure us from the like dangers from Popery for the future, nor keep up the practice of Religion and good Morals, as putting a final end to the Schiſm, and uniting us in one Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some were of Opinion, that this was not poſſible to be done, but by a Comprehenſion; they ſaid that an opportunity for this had been ſlipt within their memories, and that now they had another very fair one, which it would be unpardonable to let paſs: beſides, they ſaw that without it, a general Toleration would paſs in Parliament, the ill conſequences of which were eaſily foreſeen. Others apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that no Condeſcention would unite us, that our Diſſenting Brethren would not be ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unleſs they could carry all before them, and that were they takn into our Communion, they would make no other uſe of the Privilege than to over-turn our Constitution as ſoon as they had an opportunity for it; and therefore they thought it was better we ſhould continue as we were, till we could have aſſurance that we ſhould not be ridiculed for making alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons unrequeſted, and without any likelihood of anſwering the end thereby propos'd. This was wholly a matter of Prudence, and who was in the right could not preſently be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb facs="tcp:60245:5"/>and therefore 'tis not to be wonder'd at that there ſhould be different ſentiments about the means in thoſe who all joyned in the ſame end. Our Friend, with whom I have often canvaſsed the Queſtion, was in his judgment, which he ſincerely followed in all things, for a Comprehenſion, and tho' he had a juſt ſenſe of the ſin of Schiſm, and look'd upon that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us as utterly unjuſtifiable, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any moment could be urg'd in defence of it; yet his Opinion was, that this was the only Method, which the preſent follies and miſtakes of Men would admit of, to establiſh the honour and intereſt of the Church, and to recover expiring Piety, Charity, and other Chriſtian Virtues, which by our diviſions had received a wound not to be cured, without the uſe of this balm. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he was prevail'd with ſo far to concern himſelf on this occaſion, as to reply to a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle piece, entituled <hi>Vox Cleri,</hi> publiſhed by a Learned and Eminent Divine, as in the name of the Clergy; which Circumſtance, with the ſtile of the anſwer being a little too faceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, for ſo aged a Divine as his Adverſary, raiſed him ſome Enemies: but had he lived never ſo long, I believe he would hardly have concern'd himſelf any further in propoſing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients of Peace, the very mentioning of which, as his experience taught him, made Men ready to Battle. The deſign of the Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion being laid aſide, the Toleration bill paſs'd
<pb facs="tcp:60245:5"/>into a Law; with prudent Limitations for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtring the places of Aſſembling, the names of Preachers, and for ſecuring the Fidelity both of them, and their people (who were to be known to what Congregation they belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) to the Government; but as it has been managed and uſed, without regard to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of the Statutes, 'tis a ſanctuary for ſuch as are, as well Enemies to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as to Religion; 'tis an aſſumed li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to avoid all civil Tyes, and to be of any Religion, or none, to worſhip God in their own way, or not to worſhip him at all; 'tis a refuge for Atheiſm, Irreligion and Prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and has produced ſuch a neglect of publick worſhip and corruption of Morals, as are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſcandalous in a Christian Kingdom. Some little Writers about this time expounded this Law to diſcharge all perſons from all obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Church-Communion in point of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but this tittle tattle was nothing to what has ſince follow'd, every one taking the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty according to the Model of <hi>Spinoſa's</hi> happy Commonwealth, to Speak and Write as he liſts.</p>
            <p>It was a little ſurprize to us, ſo ſoon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as our Controverſies with the Papiſts, and our fears from that party were over, to be encountred with a ſet of Men, who, with unuſual confidence profeſs an enmity to all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and bid defiance to the common faith of mankind; who talk wildly of a Religion,
<pb facs="tcp:60245:6"/>very improperly called ſo, which has no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon Times, Places, or Perſons, to Miniſter in holy things; a Religion without worſhip or any publick Offices, whereby it is profeſs'd, a thing never heard of before in the World. No man ought tamely to bear an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſet aſide that publick Honour that is done to the Sovereign Lord of Heaven and Earth; and no Chriſtian can be ſilent when the Lord that bought them, is openly deni'd and his Miſſion ridiculed. Whither are we going, when Pamphlets are to be ſeen on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Stall, wrote directly againſt Chriſtianity? when under the pretence of advancing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Revelation is thrown up, and at beſt is allow'd to be no more than a means of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but no neceſſitating motive of aſſent? Are theſe men of <hi>Cardan</hi> the <hi>Aſtrologer's</hi> mind, that the Law of Chriſt ſhall be chang'd? and ſhall it give way to that ſect, which all the other Philoſophers expos'd, and <hi>Epicurus</hi> be ſet up as a Maſter and Teacher, inſtead of our Bleſsed Saviour? Do they think to be too hard for God? Are they ſtronger than he? It has been obſerved, that whoever breaks vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in upon the Laws of his Country, tho' he may for a time brave it; and preſume him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beyond controul, in the end the Laws are always too hard for him, and cruſh him to nothing: and ſhall men hope to be ſafe, who ſpit in the face of Heaven, and trample all the Laws of God under their feet? <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60245:6"/>was as great a Bravo, and no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to any modern writer, in the <hi>Atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> way either in Wit or Argument; and yet Religion has kept its ground and will do ſo, whatever vain imaginations ſome few fools may entertain of gaining a victory over it; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there are thoſe who are reſolved not to give over their attempts, and ſeem to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd in a cloſe Confederacy, and with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtrength to try what they can do. The Age every one ſees, is extremely addicted to lightneſs and vanity, and to turn every thing that is grave and ſerious into ridicule; to make the beſt advantage of this prevailing humour, they have a ſort of Retainers to Atheiſm, who are as great Enemies to Reaſon as to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and have neither enquir'd into what Religion has to ſay for it ſelf, or the obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions againſt it; their work is to break a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Jeſt or two upon it, and if they can but ſet down theſe in writing, they grow into a great Opinion of their Parts, and take it for an affront for any Man to ſpeak a wiſe word in their Company. Others, for each ſeems to have his part aſſigned him according to his Genius, pretend to be men of deep thoughts, and to have ſearcht into all the ſecret Arts of <hi>Prieſt-craft,</hi> and to have examined the juggle of Myſteries to the bottom; and withal, to have a great Charity for the long miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided World, oppreſt under the Tyranny and ſlaviſh fear of Religion; and yet in all this
<pb facs="tcp:60245:7"/>their deſign ſeems to be meerly to banter man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. The Author of <hi>Chriſtianity not My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious,</hi> has wrote a labour'd Book to amuſe the world, and prove nothing; he acknowledges there are Myſteries without number, and yet will allow nothing to be call'd ſo: he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Myſteries in Revelation, where reaſon can know nothing beyond what is reveal'd, to be argued from Mysteries in nature, where rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is a proper Judge; whereas one would think that if in things knowable by reaſon, we find difficulties we cannot ſolve, it ſhould ſeem leſs ſtrange when we meet with as great in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Revelation, which we can know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of, further than they are reveal'd. He will not have a thing ſaid to be above rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe it cannot be imagined or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and yet makes above reaſon to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſomething unconceivable or unimaginable, and to be the ſame with Myſtery. He aſſerts that there is nothing in Religion, that is above reaſon, and yet confeſſes that there are things in it, of which we have not an Adaequate and Compleat Idea, which is, what is meant by being above reaſon: And becauſe we need not understand what we cannot diſcover by our natural faculties, or infinite goodneſs has not been pleas'd to reveal to us; propoſes it, as a Compendious method to all uſefull knowledge, not to trouble our ſelves or others, with what God has reveal'd, becauſe we do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all that belongs to its nature or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:60245:7"/>of exiſtence: and yet after all this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the imperfection of our knowledge, and that there are ſome things we cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, affirms that God and Eternity, are no Myſteries, for want of an Adaequate and compleat Idea of them; and that Infinity and Eternity are as little Myſterious, as that two and three make five: theſe are certainly at preſent great difficulties, but he has promis'd to ſolve them all, only he refers this to a ſecond Book; but he is ſo cautious as not to limit himſelf to any time for the publiſhing it, that depending upon health and leiſure, which he very wiſely ſays, are things in no Mans power to command at his pleaſure; and yet are much more ſo, than what he has ſo very vainly made a ſhew of undertaking. The <hi>Socinians</hi> may take it ill to be ranked with thoſe who ſpeak and write againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but 'tis too apparent that they joyn with them in their attempts upon revealed Religion, and with them carry thoſe on with ſuch Arguments, as will at laſt bear very hard upon Natural, which is not wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out its Myſteries; and God himſelf, the belief of whoſe exiſtence is the foundation of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is as incomprehenſible as any the objects of the Chriſtian Faith. Theſe men were once ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous aſserters of the Authority of the Scriptures, but being preſs'd hard with the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Principle, not to believe any thing tho' confeſt to be plainly and expreſſy reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb facs="tcp:60245:8"/>unleſs they ſaw how the thing could be; they have bethought themſelves rather to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Authority of thoſe Books than to inſiſt longer on ſuch a ſenſe of 'em, as no other Man, and 'tis hard to think they themſelves, can judge to be their meaning.</p>
            <p>Is that great principle of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the Scriptures are the ſole rule of Faith, come to this? They deſerve to be ſent to the Iſland of <hi>Anticyra,</hi> if they have any thoughts of utterly running down revealed Religion; but they may prepare the way for that Church, which by ſo many Arts and Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems has attempted to overthrow the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and 'tis an exceſs of Charity, not to believe that ſome of 'em are employed to that purpoſe, and deſignedly write to ſerve that cauſe. <hi>Socinus</hi> himſelf did vigorouſly maintain the worſhip of Chriſt; how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably with his principles may be ſeen in his diſpute with <hi>F. D.</hi> but his Followers have given it up, and take it ill that any ſhould charge them with honouring the Son, as they honour the Father; will any man deny this to be a proper ſeaſon to <hi>contend earneſtly for the Faith once deliver'd?</hi> and can a Chriſtian not call to mind, on this occaſion, thoſe words of our Bleſſed Saviour, <hi>whoſoever ſhall confeſs me before men, him will I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs before my Father, which is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi> Theſe conſiderations awakened the zeal of this excellent Man I am ſpeaking of, to
<pb facs="tcp:60245:8"/>ſtand betwixt the living and the dead, and to try to ſtop the plague that was begun; to this purpoſe he firſt drew up a diſcourſe of Myſteries in Religion, which, not publiſhing at that time, he afterwards contracted into two of thoſe diſcourſes that were in the Preſs at his death. After this, he applyed himſelf to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the <hi>Socinian</hi> Controverſie, as it relates to the Doctrines of the ever Bleſsed and Adorable Trinity, about which, he ſpent much time, and many thoughts; he was fully perſwaded that herein lay Chriſtianity, as diſtinct from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Religion, and that upon the <hi>Socinian</hi> principles, it was impoſſible to clear the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from being purpoſely wrote to lead man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into the groſsest Errors and plain Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: and that take Chriſtianity at the beſt it could amount to no more than an Inſtitution of Morals, that Myſterious Method of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of mankind by the Incarnation, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Paſſion of the Son of God, and all the hopes of ſinners from a Covenant of Grace, being hereby entirely given up. Theſe thoughts were enough to ſtartle any one, who had a concern for the honour, or being of Chriſtianity. He firſt ſet himſelf carefully to examine the Sacred Records, which ſpeak ſo plainly of the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, as diſtinct Perſons from the Father; and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſsert their Divinity, that it was juſt matter of wonder to him, how this could be overlook'd or miſtaken: we are indeed amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb facs="tcp:60245:9"/>with Eaſtern phraſes and proper Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms of ſpeech, long ago out of uſe, which, if underſtood, we are told, would make that ſence eaſie to us, which ſome are pleas'd to put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sacred Oracles: but if the memory of theſe be perfectly loſt, how comes it to be known that there were ever any ſuch in uſe? and yet, unleſs they know what they were, how can they pronounce them ſerviceable to their cauſe? but if any remain, why are they not produc'd or ſome other Book inſtanc'd in, wherein any foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of 'em remain? The notion which the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Jews</hi> had of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> is, That he was God who ſhould become incarnate. Of this there are ſufficient intimations in the Prophets, and it was the received ſence of the ancient <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Church; the Conception of him as a meer Man, was an error which ſprung from that groſs expectation they had of him, as a Prince and a mighty Conqueror, who ſhould advance the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation above all the Kingdoms of the Earth. And this ancient notion of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is doubtleſs a better rule to follow, in interpreting what is ſaid of him in the writings of the new Teſtament, than to confound theſe by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a ſence upon them, contrary to what the words import, and referring us to phraſes, that no body knows any thing of, to make it out. But whatever thoſe Eaſtern Idioms of ſpeech were, the Primitive Church could not be ignorant of them, and their Faith and Worſhip muſt be allow'd to be a full evidence
<pb facs="tcp:60245:9"/>of the ſenſe in which they underſtood theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writings; 'tis true, there were ſome whoſe Memory can be no credit to any Party, who in the very age of the Apoſtles, impugned our Saviour's Divinity: but againſt theſe, St. <hi>John</hi> wrote his Goſpel, beginning it with as full and expreſs aſſertions of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Divinity, as can be imagined; and in his Epiſtles he calls theſe Hereticks the Anti-Chriſt that were already come. Afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe <hi>Praxeas, Noetus,</hi> and after both, about the middle of the third age, <hi>Sabellius;</hi> theſe preſt with the Authority of Scripture, which ſo expreſly declares the Son and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt to be God, aſſerted only one Perſon <hi>trinominem,</hi> which was owning a Trinity on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of names: againſt theſe the Church decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Chriſtian Faith as it was written and as it had received and kept it, that the Father is not the Son, nor the Son the Father, nor the Holy Ghoſt Father, or Son; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>alius à filio,</hi> the Son <hi>alius à Patre,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt <hi>alius a Patre &amp; Filio,</hi> each to be conſider'd under his proper Character, and in himſelf as a diſtinct Perſon, tho' all three united in one indiviſible nature. In the ſame age we meet with <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Samoſata,</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Zenobia</hi> to the Chair of <hi>Antioch,</hi> he is properly ſtyl'd the Father of our modern <hi>Socinians,</hi> for he aſſerted that Chriſt was a meer Man, and had no exiſtence before his Conception in the Womb of the Holy Virgin,
<pb facs="tcp:60245:10"/>and was the Author of that fooliſh contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory Notion of a <hi>Deus factus,</hi> and the <hi>Socinians</hi> have only reviv'd his Hereſie, which was condemned in the Council of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and in a ſecond himſelf depos'd. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the next age, <hi>Arrius</hi> a Presbyter of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> ſets up to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of a new Hereſie, differing both from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius</hi> and <hi>Paulus,</hi> but agreeing with them in oppoſing the Divinity of our Bleſsed Lord; he maintain'd another Eſſence of the Son and denied his Coeternity and Equality with the Father; and many falling in with him, the whole cauſe was publickly heard, the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Texts of Scripture, and the conſtant Tradition of the Church about the ſence of them carefully examin'd, and the Worſhip of the whole Chriſtian Church appeal'd to, and by theſe was the Chriſtian Faith explain'd and aſſerted. The fourth age being the time fix'd on, and the Eaſtern Church, the Stage on which theſe things were done; our Author, who had a mind to look thorough this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, ſet upon examining the Records and Writings of that time, that are extant, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly he carefully peruſed the Confeſſions and Decrees of the great Councils of <hi>Nice,</hi> and the firſt of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> wherein were no new Articles of Faith fram'd, but the old ones declared and explain'd, which the Church has both Authority and Obligation to do, as the riſe and growth of Hereſies make this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary;
<pb facs="tcp:60245:10"/>and the works of thoſe two great Men, St. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> and St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and he found full ſatisfaction, and met with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat recompenſe, for all the pains his ſearch had coſt him. Being to Preach in his courſe at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> on <hi>Trinity Sunday,</hi> he pitch'd upon thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>1. Cor. 8.5. but to us there is but one God,</hi> as the Theme of his diſcourſe; this he did not only with reſpect to the day, which was ſufficient to juſtifie him in undertaking ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, in ſo Learned an Auditory; but with regard to the boldneſs of our <hi>Socinian</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, who have been very free in char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Doctrine of the Trinity with Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, Contradictions, and Impoſſibilities. What he propos'd was to defend our Common Faith of the Divine Trinity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, which is the peculiar Scheme and Conſtitution, and Character of Chriſtianity; and to reſolve that obvious difficulty of believing thoſe Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, to be each of them God, which is the Chriſtian Faith, and yet to maintain with the Apoſtle that to us Chriſtians <hi>there is but one God.</hi> It ſo fell out that ſome paſsages, or rather words, (as is very common in the tranſient hearing a diſcourſe) were not rightly apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, which had like to have been the occaſion of a diſpute betwixt him and ſome of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, very eminent for their Learning, and of known zeal for the Common Faith. This
<pb facs="tcp:60245:11"/>occaſion'd his Letter in defence of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to the Right Reverend Biſhop of <hi>R.</hi> who, as he was by his place a proper Judge to be appeal'd to; is upon all other accounts ſo qualified, that no Man who knows him, would refuſe his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpirage in any thing, wherein Learning and Judgment joyn'd with Integrity and Candor, are required: but it went not ſo far, for he was ſoon better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and both ſides ſatisfi'd. 'Tis not neceſsary for me to ſay, why that diſcourſe has not been yet publiſhed; the reaſon is not that any thing new is advanced in it, or what is not exactly agreeable with the Notion, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Terms of the Church, in conſtant uſe at the time when this Queſtion was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſs'd: ſome of the Authorities produced by him, the World has already judg'd of; I ſay ſome, for he has collected a great many more to the ſame purpoſe, but he thought theſe ſufficient. The laſt Winter of his life he ſpent in reviewing his thoughts on this Argument, and examining them with all poſſible ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by the Scriptures and the Church Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords; and it was great ſatisfaction to him that he had clear'd his own thoughts about this Adorable Myſtery, and found nothing to lie uneaſie to them, in believing with the whole Chriſtian Church upon the Authority of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, that there is but one Eſſence, which we call God, and yet that in the Godhead, there are three Perſons of the ſame Eſſence and
<pb facs="tcp:60245:11"/>Power and Coeternal; taking the name Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the ſence of the Church, not for a meer different mode or manner of ſubſisting, or in a metaphorical ſence, but for what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſubſiſts: and he hop'd he had done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the clearing other Mens thoughts; however, the honour of our Saviour and of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion, were the things he had in his Eye, and were ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended by him, in all that he had ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Preach'd or Wrote on that ſubject.</p>
            <p>The World ſeems at preſent to stand ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much in need of ſuch Men, who want nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Learning nor Courage to ſtop the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults of the Enemies, not to this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church, but to Chriſtianity it ſelf; and tho' God whoſe counſels are unſearchable takes away ſome at a time when they were likely to have been moſt uſefull, yet he will always leave a ſufficient number thus qualified to defend his own cauſe. I dare not now undertake to give a full and juſt Character of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, I will venture to ſay ſomething, but what, I am ready to own, falls ſhort of him; he was a Man of great natural endowments, and what is more to his commendation, of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable induſtry; he never left a ſubject till he had ſearch'd it to the bottom, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cleared his own thoughts about it: In his younger years he was much taken with Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental Philoſophy, having from his firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into Books and Things, always ſet the
<pb facs="tcp:60245:12"/>higheſt value upon that knowledge he thought moſt uſefull, and by a Collection of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions left under his hand, it appears that he had ſpent ſome time and pains that way. In the year <hi>1681. Novem. 23.</hi> I find him ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>Fellow of the Royal Society;</hi> but upon his ſettling in <hi>London,</hi> he laid aſide thoſe ſtudies and wholly apply'd himſelf to that, which was his proper Profeſſion: his chief aim being now to do the utmoſt good he could among thoſe over whom he had a paſtoral care, in that renowned City. The effects of his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours remain to my own knowledge, among ſome of his Pariſhioners, who have own'd to me the great benefit they have receiv'd by his constant Preaching, both in helping them right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to underſtand and engaging them in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious practice of Religion, and by his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings they are more generally known. The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting a whole Pariſh from Houſe to Houſe, I cannot ſay to be a neceſſary part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral care, I rather lay it in faithfully and conſtantly diſcharging the publick Offices. It would be a ſad thing to be accountable for the neglect of what in great Pariſhes is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd to be impracticable; this therefore can only be an occaſional duty, in which, a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt be left to his own prudence, who is beſt able to judge what good is likely to be done in this way, and when. I have heard our Friend ſay more than once, that if he could ſee the neceſſity of it, or thoſe wonderfull ends
<pb facs="tcp:60245:12"/>it would ſerve, he would throw up all his own concerns, and apply himſelf wholly to it: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he ſupply'd the want of that, in the beſt manner he could, and by ways he thought much more uſefull to ſuch as were diſpos'd to mind the concerns of their Souls. For the uſe of his Pariſhioners he first compos'd, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by Printing it, offer'd to their cloſer conſideration his admirable <hi>Practical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Repentance,</hi> wherein he has recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd many miſtakes and looſe notions about this Doctrine; ſuch as have had a very fatal influence upon the lives of many, who all the while looked upon themſelves in a ſafe ſtate: they are chiefly owing, as I apprehend, to their not diſtinguiſhing betwixt baptiſmal Repentance, and the Repentance for willful ſins, many and long continued in, after Men have covenanted with God for a constant courſe of obedience. Two days before he died, he thank'd God that he had lived to publiſh that Diſcourſe; <hi>Not,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>That it is Wrote with that care and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs it might have been, for it was compos'd in parts, and at ſeveral diſtant times; but I think it may be ſerviceable, which is the only end I propoſed in it, to teach the right knowledge and practice of that duty.</hi> I am ſenſible that ſome have taken exceptions at what he affirmed of the invalidity of a Death-bed Repentance, but 'tis no more than is ſaid by many others, and as far as I ſee, muſt be own'd by all, who
<pb facs="tcp:60245:13"/>throughly examine that ſubject. The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not what God may do, or ſometimes does, by an extraordinary act of Grace, but what he has covenanted for, or what are the plain and indiſpenſible conditions of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required by the Goſpel. A Malefactor, upon whom the Law has pronounc'd death, may be pardoned by ſpecial favour; and if a ſinner, who never repents till he comes to die, be ſav'd, this is ſhowing him more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than is covenanted for in the Goſpel-Law of Life: and in what inſtances God will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of thoſe Terms, no Man can tell, and 'tis the higheſt folly and madneſs to truſt to it, without a particular Revelation. That God will make allowance for Mens Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in this World, and judge their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral caſes with the greateſt equity, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their rewards and puniſhments according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, come within the Terms of covenanted Grace and Mercy; but the Queſtion is whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the a Miniſter of the Goſpel, who viſits an habitually wicked Man, in his laſt ſickneſs, can aſſure him, he ſhall be ſaved on ſuch a Repentance; if it comes up to the Terms of the Goſpel, he may give him this aſsurance; and then this Doctrine may be Preach'd, yea, and ought to be for all the Goſpel-conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life, and Salvation are to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all. Such Preaching would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comfortable to thoſe who would be glad to ſave their Souls, and yet are very loth to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
<pb facs="tcp:60245:13"/>their ſins; and are not like to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this, as long as they have any hopes of ſecuring them by repenting when they come to die; Theſe ſeem to be very plain conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of allowing the ſufficiency of a death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Repentance, by the terms of the Goſpel. For his Pariſhioners, he likewiſe drew up a Manual of Devotion, to be uſed daily in their families, and put a great number of them into the hands of the Collecter of his Tythes to be diſtributed among them: he apprehended the decay of Piety and coruption of manners to be in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure owing to the neglect of family Religion, which be therefore took the opportunity after this to recommend in a Sermon preach'd before the Lord Mayor, and Court of Aldermen, whoſe example was like to give the beſt Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it: which they ſo well approv'd of as to deſire him to publiſh it. His thoughts were that the true cauſe of the general neglect of Family Devotion, is the wrong notion Men have entertained of Forms of Prayer, which is a thing ſo paſt all diſpute, that it muſt lie upon the Conſciences of thoſe who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied 'em, if, now that the effects of that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror are found ſo evidently ruinous to Piety and good Morals, they do not in ſome publick way retract it, and adviſe to the uſe of Forms, without which the uſe of conſtant Family Prayer can never be retriev'd. He was ſo intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doing good among his people, that he was often propoſing to himſelf and asking his Friends
<pb facs="tcp:60245:14"/>to think of ſomething wherein he might be moſt uſefull to them; he endeavour'd to free the minds of other Men, as he has done his own from falſe and looſe principles in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, the effects of which will in a ſhort time appear in the Life and Practice. His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion did not lie in ſhows and meer forms of Godlineſs, which we need not an Apoſtles Teſtimony to aſsure us, may be ſeparated from the power of it; I take him to have been in that ſtate deſcribed by St. <hi>John</hi> when he ſays, <hi>he that is born of God doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin becauſe he is born of God;</hi> He would not, I dare ſay, for all the World have committed a known, willfull, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate ſin, and I am ſure would have been horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly afraid of himſelf if he had fallen into one ſuch ſin. I could here give in evidence for what I ſay, if it were neceſsary, a ſignal inſtance of a vigorous ſence of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a reſolved and confirm'd vertue, ſuch an one as is not very common. I herein ſay no more of him, than what in Juſtice is due, and what by long experience and many proofs I know to be true of him; he did not indeed diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thoſe ſigns of Grace, which ſome Men expect to find in the face; he had not that affected gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and down-look and dull humour, which a Phariſee would perhaps have ſought for, as a viſible mark of it; He was always cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and gay himſelf, and would ſuffer none to
<pb facs="tcp:60245:14"/>be otherwiſe, where-ever he came: This, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, if any thing was an exceſs in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it muſt be own'd, that he would be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times merry at other Mens coſt, who could not bear up againſt the ſharpneſs of his wit, which I therefore place among his imperfections. But though he gave way poſſibly too much to that facetiouſneſs and pleaſant air of Converſation, which was very natural to him, and as he thought in mixt Company moſt agreeable; yet in a cloſer Converſation, or when at any time the Argument requir'd it, he knew how to be ſerious; and was pleas'd when any ſubject was ſtarted that required grave talk and ſtrict rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning: beſides, he oft took the opportunity of conveying right notions of things and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome Vices in a jocular way, when he knew not how to do this in any other way; this deſign he often had of doing good, and found it ſucceſsfull where it was leaſt perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His Character as a Friend concerns on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly particular Perſons, who have drawn it at large on their own minds; it ſignifies not much to ſay any of this to others, but if any be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to know it, I refer them to <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s rules to diſtinguiſh a Flatterer from a Friend. His Friendſhip being grounded upon principles of vertue, his paſſion for his Friend was not Connterfeit, nor his Converſation with him forc'd, but natural and eaſie and all of a piece; he always uſed freedom and would neither fall in with, nor decline taking notice of what he
<pb facs="tcp:60245:15"/>thought was amiſs in his Friend: he was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to aſſiſt him to the uttermoſt of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and would embark with him in whatever was fair and honeſt, and nothing elſe; and would always defend him in his abſence.</p>
            <p>I have now brought him to the laſt Stage of his life, and you are to ſee him die. Now is the trueſt Judgment to be made of the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Steadineſs of a Man's principles, and the ſincerity and regularity of his actions. Now all meer forms of Godlineſs are diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the Masks of Hypocriſie fall off, and 'tis no longer a time to diſsemble with God or Man; I am very well aware that ſome very pious Perſons, who have no reaſon for it are under great fears at the approach of death; Natural temper or an habitual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy heightned by the preſent indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of body, with a ſinall tincture of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is incident to very ſincere Perſons, may cauſe their hearts to miſgive them; and put them into frights they know not why, and when there is no ground for them: on the other ſide, ſome Enthuſiaſts there are who have no manner of claim to happineſs by the terms of the Goſpel, but have the higheſt reaſon to be afraid of that Juſt Judgment that ſhall render to every Man according to his works; who yet meet death in a ſort of Triumph and Extaſie, and talk in the wildeſt manner of the certainty of their Salvation: this is the effect of the vileſt of all principles; for ſuch are
<pb facs="tcp:60245:15"/>thoſe which cancell the obligations of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and ſuperſede the neceſſity of a holy life to ſalvation.</p>
            <p>But whatever wrong Judgment Men make of themſelves, God will Judge righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and neither the cauſeleſs fears of good Men, not the vain preſumptions of bad Men, ſhall have any influence on their future ſtate. So ſoon as the vital union betwixt Soul and Body is diſsolv'd, the one ſhall find themſelves ſafe, notwithſtanding their fears; and the other miſerably diſappointed under all their bold and groundleſs conſidence: But ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking to depart not in Raptures, but in Peace, to die with an undiſturb'd yet thoughtfull mind; with a ſenſe of our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, and yet, with a full truſt in God's promiſes, ('till the bodily diſtemper riſes ſo high as to take away the free uſe of our facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; after which, all that any Man ſays or does ſtands for nothing) I take to be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and natural reward of a vertuous Life. He who has liv'd conſtantly under a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſenſe of God and of another World, who has often had his thoughts in that inviſible ſtate, and in all his Actions has manifeſted his firm belief of, and earneſt deſire to reach the happineſs propos'd; ſhould, one would think, not find it any great diſſiculty to leave this World to enter upon one far better. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder this happy and moſt deſirable compoſure of mind was this admirable Man, and ſincere
<pb facs="tcp:60245:16"/>Chriſtian at the approach of Death, which he had ſeen advancing towards him for ſome time, and ſenſibly felt it drawing nearer him by degrees. The 7th. of <hi>February 1696</hi> was the laſt time of his appearing in the Pulpit; he then found himſelf very ill, and that the Sentence of Death was upon him: for that reaſon he choſe to venture abroad to take his final leave of his people in the ſolemneſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to cloſe up his Miniſtery by Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring to them and partaking with them of the Bleſſed Sacrament of our Saviour's Body and Blood; which he ever look'd upon as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to be a part of publick Chriſtian wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and in the firſt Ages not administred to dying Perſons on their ſick beds, unleſs they were in a ſtate of Penance, and were hereby to be reſtored to the Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church. The notion of a <hi>Via<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum</hi> he look'd upon as brought in with ſuperſtition, and that it tended to uphold it; upon which principle, many who neglect this duty all their life long, are very earneſt for it at their deaths, upon the like reaſon that the <hi>Clinici</hi> deferr'd the other Sacrament till the laſt hour. His Diſcourſe was upon theſe words, <hi>Luke 12.40. Be ye therefore rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for the Son of Man cometh at an hour when ye think not.</hi> He deſigned this as his own Funeral Sermon, as he told the Reverend Mr. <hi>M.</hi> the worthy Lecturer of that Pariſh, as he came out of the Church,
<pb facs="tcp:60245:16"/>and his good Friend Mr. <hi>S.</hi> with whom he din'd that day. He was ſo far ſpent in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was forc'd to deſire his aſſist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to conſecrate the Elements, and only gave the Cup himſelf. On the 17th. I providentially came to him, and had the happineſs to attend him to his laſt moments. He had been that day riding abroad to try if he could find any relief from the air, and coming home, ſoon after I was got to his Lodgings, which were then at <hi>Iſlington,</hi> his first Salutation was after this manner. <hi>My Friend, I have been in expectation of ſeeing thee theſe two days, and glad I am that thou art now come, for 'tis to ſee me die, and aſſiſt me in dying, which is a very kind and friendly Office.</hi> Great part of that day we were ſhut up together, and he entertain'd me with ſuch admirable Diſcourſes, on the moſt important Subjects, and talk'd ſo clearly and with ſo lively a ſenſe of them, that I forgot I was converſing with a dying Friend, and thought it one of the pleaſanteſt days of my whole Life. He began with a Diſcourſe of the empty projects and deſigns of this Life, and the intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble folly of being entirely taken up with the Pleaſures and Enjoyments, with the cares and thoughts, and buſineſs of this World, when we are every day liable to enter upon a new and unſeen ſtate, which above all things it
<pb facs="tcp:60245:17"/>concerns us to take care about, and wiſely to provide for. This Life is a continu'd round and circle of bodily Actions and Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but in death theſe ceaſe, and have an end; that let's down the Curtain, and the Drama of Life is over, and whatever parts we Acted on this Stage, we lay them all aſide; and what we enjoy'd in this Body and this World, is to be no more, and as if it had never been, and we only had dream'd of it for a while. He taketh away their breath, they die and turn again to their duſt, <hi>That,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>is my preſent Caſe,</hi> and in that very day all their Thoughts periſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> all their apprehenſions of Worldly Happineſs and Enjoyments with all their mighty projects and deſigns they had here: how reaſonable then is it for us frequently to meditate upon dying, and how properly was it plac'd of old among the firſt rules and principles of Wiſdom. And upon my ſaying to him, that as he ſeemed to be got almoſt to the end of the race of Life, his Friends were running hard after him, and would in a ſhort ſpace overtake him; he replied, <hi>True, but prithee remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that I have got the ſtart of thee.</hi> Here he took occaſion to diſcourſe of the Chriſtian Revelation, which has diſcovered the moſt amazing, but the moſt important and momentous Truths for Man to know: 'Tis this, ſaid he, that gives me the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt eaſe and ſatisfaction in my preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb facs="tcp:60245:17"/>and fills my mind with the moſt ſerene hopes, when I can find pleaſure in nothing elſe; and without it all my thoughts, when I ſtretch them as far as ever they will go, are either dark or troubleſome. That God ſhould ſend his only begotten Son into the World in our likeneſs to redeem and ſave Mankind, that he ſhould propoſe by him the advancing us, who are very inconſiderable, yea, ſinfull Creatures to ſuch a height of Glory, as to be equal to Angels, to ſee God as he is, and to have eternally communicated to us of his own Excellencies and Perfections, cannot but affect every one who believes and exerciſes his thoughts about theſe matters, with Wonder and Admiration, with all poſſible Love and Gratitude, and a moſt ſollicitous ſtudy, and endeavour to obey God univerſally, in hopes of that eternal Life, <hi>which God, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie,</hi> as the Apostle ſpeaks, has <hi>promiſed.</hi> He added, That the deſign of Chriſtianity and the Terms of Life therein propos'd, did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to him ſo very plain, that it was juſt matter of amazement, how any Men who had look'd into thoſe records and conſider'd their own nature, and had any notion of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of reaſonable Creatures, could miſs of underſtanding them aright. The <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Scheme he look'd upon as directly <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian,</hi> and the very worſt that the moſt malicious Enemies of the Chriſtian name could poſſibly have invented; and he gave me a very
<pb facs="tcp:60245:18"/>ſad inſtance of a Perſon who liv'd many years in the habit of a very groſs ſin, and yet had a quiet Conſcience, and thought himſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſafe upon thoſe principles, 'till being ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a publick Diſcourſe of his, God made him an Inſtrument of ſetting the poor Man right in his Notions, and engaging him to reform his Life; for which his new Convert was very thankfull, and aſſur'd him, That he would not for all the World have liv'd ſo long in the habit of that ſin, if he had believed, as he thoroughly did now, that it would have hazarded his Salvation. Here he took occaſion to ſay that he was much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in his notion of the nullity of a Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Repentance, by conſidering his preſent Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. <hi>What could I do,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Were I now to begin to Repent of a long Wicked life? I profeſs, I could not have the leaſt hopes of my Salvation; but, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God, this is not my own Caſe, I am ſenſible of a vaſt number of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Imperfections; but they are ſuch, as I am well aſſur'd, the Covenant of Grace will make an allowance for: I can ſay I have been Sincere in the main deſigns of my Life; and, I thank God, I make no queſtion of being happy, when I can once get looſe from this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of an Earthly infirm body, and ſhall be ſet above thoſe Imperfections, which cannot be wholly remedied in this ſtate,
<pb facs="tcp:60245:18"/>and to be freed from which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the next.</hi> He gave me his thoughts at large, about the Doctrine of the ever bleſsed Trinity, which are not needfull to be here ſet down, eſpecially ſince I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken ſome notice of that Matter. All that I ſhall add, is, That he never intended any Controverſie with thoſe who believed this Doctrine; his buſineſs was to defend it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe who oppoſed it, and he was fully ſatisfied, that what he had Preach'd and Wrote on this ſubject, was agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the ſenſe of the Church; and he was fully confirmed in his Thoughts, by the judgment of the moſt Learned and unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable Divines of our Church. The Right Reverend Biſhop <hi>Pearſon</hi> explains the Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity as he has done, and aſſerts the neceſſity of it, for avoiding that old and ſo often urg'd objection Tritheiſm: <hi>It is moſt neceſſary,</hi> ſays he, <hi>To aſſert that there is but one Perſon, who is from none; for if there were more than one, which were from none, it could not be deny'd but that there were more Gods than one: This Origination of the Divine Paterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath anciently been look'd upon, as the aſſertion of the Unity, and therefore, the Son and the Holy Ghoſt are but one God with the Father, becauſe both from the Father, who is one, and ſo the Union of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:60245:19"/>
            <p>He perfectly concurred with this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Perſon, who, without any queſtion, is allow'd to ſpeak the ſenſe of the Catholick Church; and with the Fathers of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, as their ſenſe is exprest in their Creed, which is a part of our Liturgy. He believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, were one God, and yet three real diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as evidently diſtinguiſh'd in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as united in their Nature: The Father is not the Son, nor the Holy Ghoſt; the Son is not the Father, nor the Holy Ghoſt; the Holy Ghoſt is neither the Father nor the Son: the true and living God can be but one, the Father is originally the one God; the Son is the ſame God, but not originally of himſelf, but has his Divine Eſſence by Communication from the Father; the Holy Spirit is the ſame God, not originally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of himſelf, but having the ſame Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature and Eſſence, common both to the Father and the Son, communicated by them both to him; So that Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt are one God. The Father ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally that one Eſſence of infinite Wiſdom, Power, and Majeſty: The one Perſon origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally of himſelf, ſubſiſting in that infinite Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; The Son is God of God, by being of the Father; the Holy Ghoſt is God of God, by being of the Father, and the Son, as receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Infinite and Eternal Eſſence from them both: this is the explication of that
<pb facs="tcp:60245:19"/>adorable Myſtery, as 'tis deliver'd by that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prelate forementioned, in his Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Book upon the Apoſtles Creed. By this time his ſpirits and his breath fail'd him, and he could proceed no further; and now having entertain'd me as long as he could, he gave me to underſtand, That I muſt not expect much more from him, about one thing or other; but that he would look to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd by me, the little time I ſhould have him with me: And immediately calling the Family to Prayers; ſo ſoon as they were ended, he went to Bed, and was willing I ſhould leave him for that night. In the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which was <hi>Thurſday,</hi> he deſir'd me to accompany him in his Chariot, to <hi>London</hi> to conſult Dr. <hi>M</hi> —, not that he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any relief from his preſcriptions, for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded himſelf too far gone to be recovered, but becauſe he thought it not fit to omit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that could be done, for the ſake of his Family chiefly, whoſe intereſt it was that he ſhould have liv'd a little longer with them. I returned with him to his Lodgings, but he found himſelf ſo far ſpent, that he haſtned to Bed, and deſired me to come up to his Chamber, and in the Church form to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Soul to God. Not being willing to ſink his Spirits too much, and preſuming that his apprehenſions of preſent Death were the effect of the diſorder his Journey had thrown him into, I made uſe of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:60245:20"/>Collects proper at that time, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely omitted the commendatory Prayer; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he called to me, and entreated me to uſe no other than that, and, if I pleas'd, the Lord's Prayer with it, <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I am juſt going.</hi> So ſoon as I had done, <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>I now thank thee, and take my leave of thee: I have nothing more to ſay to thee, nor needſt thou ſay any thing to me, thou haſt nothing further to do, but to bid me good night.</hi> And imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately turning himſelf on one ſide, lay ſtill, and ſpoke no more all that night. On <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> morning he told me, he wondered to find himſelf alive; however, we perſwaded him to bleed, according to the Dr.'s order the night before, he told us it was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and had an opinion he ſhould die whilſt he was bleeding; but he added, that he gave up his body to our management, and we might do with it, as we pleaſed: by this time his Friend Dr. <hi>T</hi> — came in, to whom he talk'd ſenſibly of his caſe, and told him he was ſo well skill'd in his Profeſſion, that he knew very well he could not live out another night. The Dr. was no ſooner gone, but he called me to him, and attempted a Diſcourſe which he was not able to go thro' with; what he aim'd at was ſomething to this purpoſe: <hi>What a poor Creature is Man, if he had hopes only in this Life, he muſt go naked and alone, and without any Friend to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<pb facs="tcp:60245:20"/>him to the dark Grave? All that thou wilt ſee of me preſently will be a ſtiff and ſenſeleſs carkaſs: I have already loſt all my thought, I can ſcarce tell what I ſay to thee, I did not juſt now know where I was; now I do; I am in my Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber; I have no power to command a thought; thou ſhalt in a few moments ſee that they are all periſh'd and gone.</hi> This he repeated ſeveral times with ſome concern; and, in half an hour, they went quite away, and returned no more, for all that afternoon he lay ſtill, only at ten at night he put forth one hand to me, and lifted up the other, and his eyes to Heaven, to ſignifie to me, that he had yet ſome knowledge, tho' his ſpeech was gone, and that he was praying for himſelf, and a little after midnight he breath'd his laſt. I have ſeen many Perſons die, but none like him in all my life: I heard not the leaſt unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word from him in all his illneſs, which was to me the more ſtrange, becauſe I knew the natural heat and eagerneſs of his temper; he ſhew'd not the leaſt ſign of uneaſineſs or diſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in his circumſtances, nothing of fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for this World, or any deſire to ſtay longer in it; no manner of fear of death, or doubts about his future good ſtate, but throughout his ſickneſs, and to the laſt minutes that his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding continued, a perfect contempt of all Earthly things, vigorous hopes of a Bleſſed Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and an entire and abſolute reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:60245:21"/>of himſelf to the Will of God. The truth is, his behaviour was enough to make a Man in love with death, and to long for a diſsolution, and at that time it made ſuch an impreſſion upon my ſpirits, that while it laſted, I thought I could with great eaſe have dy'd with him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been longer than I intended in my account of the Author, I ſhall leave the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes to ſpeak for themſelves. There is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently a ſpirit of true Piety that breaths in them, and one general aim propos'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a wiſe underſtanding and ſincere practice of Religion: They are publiſh'd as they were found in his ordinary Notes, and not deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him for the Preſs, but if they may do any ſervice to God and Religion, and the Souls of Men, Our Author himſelf would have ventur'd them Abroad into the World, without being any ways concern'd for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and imperfections, which may be ſpy'd out in 'em; for, in the proſecution of ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ends, he has declar'd himſelf ſufficiently arm'd againſt all manner of cenſures whatſoever, and publickly profeſs'd, <hi>That it was more ſatisfaction to him to publiſh a few plain and uſefull Diſcourſes,</hi>

               <p>THE Apoſtle in defence of Chriſtianity, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles being received into it, who were Strangers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens, rather than the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and God's peculiar People, having to juſtifie this, made uſe of an Inſtance of God's free diſpoſing his Favours as he pleaſes, and ſuch as to the <hi>Jews</hi> was an unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Preſident, becauſe upon it all their Priviledges depended, above the reſt of the World; the ſame Children, not of <hi>Abraham</hi> only, but of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whoſe line the promiſed Seed was confined, before
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60245:22"/>they were either of them born, or were in a capacity to do Good or Evil, yet God declared that <hi>Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated,</hi> v. 13. and notwithſtanding the rights of Primogeniture, yet tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this his Love and Hatred down even to their Poſterities, the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the <hi>Edomites;</hi> upon this he ſeems to be ſtartled with an Objection, riſing up from all this, and looking him fully in the Face; <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? is their unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with God? God forbid.</hi> This is ſo ſhrewd an abſurdity, that if we muſt be driven to it, 'tis a demonſtration againſt not only Chriſtianity, which he was defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but againſt all Religion: For. if God be not a Being of Righteouſneſs and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in what he does, who can expect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for ſerving him, or need ſear puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for any wickedneſs he commits; Virtue and Vice are but empty names, if he has not an impartial regard to them, and his own words are not to be truſted or credited, if we queſtion his Righteouſneſs and Integrity; if we are not well aſſured of that in the firſt place, we can never know but he may deceive us, in whatever he ſays, or promiſes to us, nay, all his Revelations may be but like the Heathens deceitful Oracles, to impoſe upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, and all his Miracles but tricks of Legerdemain, and ſlights of an Almighty
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60245:22"/>hand to deceive us more artificially; but <hi>God forbid,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays, that any ſuch thing ſhould blaſphemouſly be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the great God, or any ſuch No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions formed of him, from whence it is unavoidable to infer them. Tho we can never get the thoughts of him out of our mind, nor wholly take out the Natural Characters of him, that he has imprinted upon us, yet if we ſo blur, and deface them, with lines drawn from our own ill Tempers or miſtaken Apprehenſions, as to repreſent him inſtead of his Eſſential Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, and Moral Perfections, which are the brighteſt Glory that ſhines all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him, with the black and ugly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Almighty Rage and Cruelty, Malignant Spite, or Ill Nature; or which may be the ſame, Imperious, and Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Ungoverned Will, conducted by no Principles of Juſtice, or Goodneſs, nor acting by any Rules of Right, or Wrong, but as the unaccountable impulſes of Fondneſs or Anger happen to incline him; if we ſet up ſuch a monſtrous Idol in our thoughts with ghaſtly looks, and terrible viſage, inſtead of the moſt Perfect, and Righteous, and Bleſſed God, as we do the greateſt diſhonour to the Divine Nature, mere than if the <hi>Jews</hi> had really ſet up an Aſſes head, as they were charged to adore, for the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo we deſtroy that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60245:23"/>inward love and delight, that hearty e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem and veneration which the thoughts of ſo excellent and amiable, ſo great and good, and juſt a Being ſhould excite in us, and do a great many other the ſaddeſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs to True Religion; as I ſhall ſhew by and by: We make it a deſirable thing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the beſt of Men, that there were no ſuch Being i'the World, under whoſe Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, for ſuch is Power without Juſtice, they may be made miſerable, as well as others, and all muſt groan under his Iron Scepter, and have reaſon to wiſh they could wreſt it out of his Clutches, but none could kiſs it, or be ſatisfied with it; they might tremble and crouch, and bow before it, offer Prayers, as the <hi>Manichees</hi> to their evil Principles, or build Temples, as the <hi>Romans</hi> to the Fever, or the Plague; they may dread him as an irreſiſtable evil, but never Worſhip, and Honour, and Eſteem him as we ought to do an Infinite God, <hi>i. e.</hi> as an Almighty Goodneſs, or an Eternal Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>But alas, who did ever deny that God was Righteous? who was ever ſo bold as to charge the great Lord and Creator of the World with the leaſt ſhadow of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs? or what pretence, or poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility indeed can there be of any ſuch thing? Is not whatever he does therefore righteous, becauſe he does it, let it be what it will?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60245:23"/>There have been many who have thought he made the greateſt part both of Men and Angels to be eternally miſerable, and doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, before they were created, to that wretched State, and that he might have dealt ſo with all the reſt, if he had pleaſed, and yet allow him to have been very righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; others have thought that he appointed that they ſhould firſt ſin, at leaſt ſome one of them, and from thence he would take occaſion to damn as many of them as he pleaſed, without any regard to their own actions; and this they thought was a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way of diſplaying his Righteouſneſs to us: But who could ever be ſo foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, as to charge God downright with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs? He that has none above him, to controul or determine him, to give any Laws, or Rules to him, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he does according to the purpoſe and pleaſure of his own Will is moſt certainly Righteous.</p>
               <p>This is the common and eaſie, but miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken account of God's righteouſneſs, which becauſe the Apoſtle here does not make uſe of as he might, and ſo have given a ſhorter anſwer to the ſuppoſed Objection, but rather allows that there is ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs, which is ſo in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which therefore could not be charged upon God; for elſe, to ſay with ſuch abhorrence, <hi>God forbid that there be
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60245:24"/>unrighteouſneſs with him,</hi> would be only to ſay, God forbid that he ſhould not do what he does, or that he ſhould not will what he wills; when if you ſuppoſe that to be what you pleaſe, yet the ſuppoſing him to will and to do it, makes it to be righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and then there would be no need of ſuch a phraſe, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as is here uſed before hand. I ſhall endeavour therefore at this time,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To lay down a better, and a firmer Notion, and account of God's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſhow you the uſefulneſs of it, by the conſequences of the other Opinion. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. To vindicate the Righteouſneſs of God according to this true Notion of it, and clear it from what either in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or any where elſe may ſeem to reflect upon it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I ſhall endeavour to lay down a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a firmer Notion of God's Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and that in theſe Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis not mere Will and Arbitrary Pleaſure that makes God to be Righteous, for that is ſuch a floating and uncertain thing, that it cannot be a fit and ſtable foundation for Righteouſneſs; mere Power and Will like a violent Wind act always ſtrongly and impetuouſly, but uncertainly too, ſometimes one way, and ſometimes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60245:24"/>the quite contrary, as the vapours happen to riſe and move it; It will fall under no certain Rules or Calculation, nor can you tell where to have it the next moment, ſo variable will be ungoverned Will, and ſo impetuous, when 'tis aſſiſted with Strength and Power, that only gives it weight and force, but determines it not one way or t'other; and if all the effects, and efforts of this were to be called Right, then the doing quite contrary things may happen to be ſo; for what ſhould hinder mere arbitrary Will from doing one thing at one time, and the quite contrary at another, unleſs it have ſomething to regulate it? The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the Righteous with the Wicked, damning Innocents, and doing all imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſchief, ſhall be called righteouſneſs, if done by the Manichean Evil, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Principle, for there can be no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between him and the good one, if what both of them will, be therefore righteous. Whilſt righteouſneſs is thus founded in Power and Will, be it never ſo great, yet if it be not bounded by any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rules of Right and Wrong, what ſhall keep it ſteddy to its ſelf, or prevent its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at one time what it diſlikes, and is therefore unrighteous at another? Like a mighty Torrent, it will rage, and rowl, and break down all before it, if it have no certain Banks, and Current to keep it in;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60245:25"/>if Juſtice and Righteouſneſs be only blind Will, without any Scales in her hands to weigh things by, it will be but the ſame with blind Chance and Fortune, and never to be diſtinguiſhed: Did the Divine Nature act by no certain and fixt Rules, it might be called Great and Powerful, but neither Juſt nor Righteous; there could be no ſuch thing, if there were not ſome unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Standard of Right and Wrong, and ſome other fixt meaſure of thoſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what Arbitrary Will made to it ſelf, according to which the Judge of all the Earth ſhall do right, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis God's acting by the unalterable rules of Righteouſneſs and Juſtice, that makes him to be righteous; and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute impoſſibility he ſhould act otherwiſe from the Rectitude and Perfection of his own Nature, there are <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60245:25"/>and are not to be altered even by God himſelf: As common Notions and Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Axioms are founded in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things themſelves, that the whole is greater then its part, that Equals ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Equals, make Equals, which are Everlaſting Truths, and can never be made otherwiſe, no, not by God himſelf, but are ſo from the mere <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects of things to one another; ſo there are alſo as Eternal and Immutable rules of Righteouſneſs fixt and determined by the Nature of things, and their Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to one another, as plain and unalte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as any Mathematical Verities, and as neceſſary Foundations for Morality and Juſtice, as the others for Science and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration; ſo that Right and Wrong is in its own Nature, as certain and unchangeable as the Nature of a Circle or a Triangle, and God can no more act contrary to theſe, than he can make the three Angles of a Triangle not equal to two right ones, or two and two not to be four, or one of the parts of a Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on not to be falſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Eternal, and Immutable Rules of Right and Wrong, by which God acts, and can no more violate, than the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible Natures, or Truths of things, are ſuch as we by our Reaſon can know, and underſtand, and make Judgment by,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60245:26"/>elſe we muſt never pretend to form a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God by them, or aſcribe any ſuch thing as Righteouſneſs to him, and when he ſo often calls himſelf <hi>the God Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and Juſt, who is without any Iniquity</hi> Deut. 32.4. and <hi>David</hi> could ſay of him, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, and thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright,</hi> Pſ. 119.137. a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that we have Idea's and concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe things, and that they are true, and agreeable to the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Nay, when God appeals to us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.25. to Judge betwixt him and others, whether his ways are equal, or no, 'tis not ſure like making a blind man Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trator about colours, or a judge of Beauty; We muſt be ſuppoſed to have Power, and Faculties to make Judgment in the Caſe, and that the Principles of Right and Wrong that are in our minds are agreeable to the nature of things, and to thoſe that God himſelf acts by: God indeed ſays in the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.8. <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor my ways your ways,</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof is not, that what we think to be juſt, and right, and equal, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears moſt plainly ſo to us, yet is quite otherwiſe in God, and of a different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for this deſtroys all our Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any Perfection in God; but the plain ſenſe of that place is, that God was not like the <hi>Jews,</hi> hard to be reconciled and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60245:26"/>unwilling to forgive injuries, that was ſpoken as an encouragement to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand juſt before, <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon, for my thoughts, are not your thoughts, nor my ways your ways.</hi> God indeed is infinitely more Wiſe, more Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, more Perfect in all things than the beſt of his Creatures, yet we muſt apply the ſame Ideas, and Apprehenſions of thoſe things which we have in our minds to him, that we do to thoſe, as we demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate alike of a greater or a leſſer Circle, or elſe we loſe all notion of his Mercy, Truth, and Righteouſneſs, and when we ſay, God cannot lie, or do what is evil, or unjuſt, we mean the very ſame thing that would be ſo in men, or elſe we muſt mean nothing.</p>
               <p>There be many Circumſtances indeed, and different caſes, and conſiderations in the Actions of God to his Creatures, and the Creatures to one another, but yet when they are allow'd for, 'tis by the ſame Scales, as I may ſay, that God weighs out Right which we alſo uſe, only there muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on his ſide be put into them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to make them even, for ſhould they be others unknown to us, we ſhould be wholly at a loſs how to weigh, or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his Actions, or how to account them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60245:27"/>to be Juſt and Righteous, or how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that truly of them: But I may ſay of Righteouſneſs, as <hi>Tully</hi> ſays of Reaſon, that it is common both to Man and God, and the very ſame Signatures and Marks of things, which are Originally in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mind, are inſtampt alſo upon all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and underſtanding Beings.</p>
               <p n="4">4. God's acting by thoſe Eternal and Immutable Rules of Righteouſneſs, is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Righteouſneſs in him, tho' he has no ſuperior to give him any Laws and Rules; for Righteouſneſs and all Virtue, the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and the nobleſt, is what proceeds rather from a Vital Principle, and inward Energy of the mind, than a ſet and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs courſe of Obedience to Laws and Rules preſcribed by another; when a great and brave Mind acts by its own wiſe and generous Principles, follows the Notices and Dictates of its own All-ſeeing Underſtanding, and its Will is always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by its own Eſſential Perfections, and a Natural Rectitude that is in it ſelf, ſo that it can no more do an ill or unjuſt thing, than change it ſelf, and put off its own Nature; this is ſuch a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that has root in it ſelf, and lives, and grows from that innate radical Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and differs as much from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as a thing that grew into ſuch a ſhape from a Plaſtick and Vital Power in it ſelf,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60245:27"/>does from that which was cut and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the hand of another. This is that Original Righteouſneſs ſpringing up in the true Fountain, like light in the Sun, whilſt Righteouſneſs in us, tho' it be of the ſame Nature, is but like that in the Air derived from it, and mixt with a great deal of darkneſs and a mere ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of Precepts and Rules, as they are preſcribed by another, and the acting from a Righteous and Inward Principle in ones own mind, are as different as the Clock-Work Motion, and flying of <hi>Regiomonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>'s Eagle, from ſome. Wheels and Wires, and the Natural Motion of a living one, from its own Spirits and Muſcles, and the force and ſpring of inward life.</p>
               <p>Thus is Righteouſneſs in God truly Righteouſneſs, tho' he has no Superior to move or determine him: And thus I have laid down what I conceive the true Notion and Fountain of Gods Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which tho' it may be too deep for ſome to ſee to the bottom, yet it ſtands upon the firmer ground, and is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movable.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſhall now ſhew you the uſefulneſs of it, from the miſchievous Conſequences of the other opinion, That Gods Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs conſiſts only in Arbitrary and Ungoverned Will.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60245:28"/>
               <p n="1">1. That takes very much off from our Obligation to Right, if there be no ſuch thing in the Divine Nature; by Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs may be meant a very large and comprehenſive Virtue, that contains al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all others under it, and there muſt be the ſame Reaſon and Foundation of thoſe as of this, and if we can conceive the God we worſhip to be without thoſe, it will greatly abate our eſteem of them and obligation to them; if we conceive that great mind is happy and perfect without thoſe, we have reaſon to think our own may be ſo too, for whatever thoughts we have of God, they muſt be the Standard and Meaſure to us of all Perfection. It is a very natural Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which St. <hi>John</hi> makes, 1 Ep. 2.29. if ye know that he is Righteous, ye know that every one that doeth Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is born of him: if Righteouſneſs be founded in the Divine Nature, then whoever is truly Righteous, is both like unto God and beloved by him as a Child of its Parent. God cannot but love and be pleaſed with what is ſo agreeble to himſelf, and bears his Divine Image and Reſemblance upon it; for the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he loves himſelf, and takes infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite complacency and ſatisfaction in his own Perfections he will love alſo thoſe who are partakers of the ſame Divine Life
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60245:28"/>and Nature, and are Righteous as he is Righteous, that is, Righteous Men, as he is a Righteous God, for that the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Lord ſhould love Righteouſneſs,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 11.7. is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of his own Natural and Eſſential Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but there is no reaſon why he ſhould not love any thing, even the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, if he were not truly Righteous him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his love depended upon mere Arbitrary Will, without regard to any thing elſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This has been therefore the ground of all Superſtition and undue Worſhip of God, and of the great miſtakes that are in Religion, the conceiving God to be a mere Great and Arbitrary Being, and only Abſolute and Almighty Will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Perfection, and the line of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; from hence Men have hoped to pleaſe him, and procure his favour with outward Pomp and Solemnity, with mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Sacrifices, and great Preſents and Oblations, with Bowings, and Cringes, and Proſtrations before him, with bended Knees, and empty Words, and a courſe of External Performances, without any true and inward Righteouſneſs; they have imagined a ſort of Religious flattery would take with him, and that it was enough to ſooth up his greatneſs with ſome offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious addreſſes, and to make their court
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60245:29"/>to him with a ſet of hollow and affected Complements; by theſe they thought God was ſufficiently obliged, and took great pleaſure in them, like ſome vain and fooliſh and haughty Mortals: Indeed was God ſuch an one as themſelves, or as they i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, he might be ſo, but if he be a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eſſentially Righteous, and Holy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, 'tis then not to be hoped, that any thing will commend us to him, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Favour but a Righteous Mind; without that, let Men diſpute as long as they pleaſe, no Man can be Elected or Juſtified, or think to be ſaved by a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous God; nor can it be worth while to contrive any Tricks or Devices whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which has been the great buſineſs of falſe Religion, by which Men would fain pleaſe God, and be very Religious, without being truly Righteous; without this neither Pennance nor Abſolution; Whipping, or going Bare-foot, Pardons, or Indulgences, Maſſes, or Pilgrimages will ſignifie any thing, and whatever we truſt or rely on, wherever we ground our Hopes, and make comfortable Reſerves and Expectations to our ſelves, will moſt certainly deceive us without Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who think God is only infinite Will, acting Arbitrarily, without obſerving any rules of Righteouſneſs, if their Conſtitution
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60245:29"/>ſuch that they are apt to have gay and pleaſing Ideas and Images of things Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to their Minds; they are incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to think that God will be eaſily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them for very little Matters, and ſo fall into that ſanguine Superſtition which I mentioned before, or think perhaps that he has Choſen and Elected them from Eternity, and their names are written in the Book of Life; but if their blood be thick, and their fancy blacker, then they imagine God to be Severe and Revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, hard to be pleaſed, and eaſily provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and implacable when he is ſo: and with theſe ſad and dreadful Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, his Mind is always haunted as with frightful Spectres, and he comes to the Temples, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, as if 'twere to the Dens of Wild Beaſts, or the Neſts of Dragons, for he conceives that God is as hurtful as any of thoſe Creatures: ſo there with a ſcared Countenance and a perplext Mind, the timorous Worſhipper offers up his Child perhaps, or the reeking Bowels of ſome Humane Sacrifice, or ſometimes his own Blood to the God he Worſhips, and thus hopes to appeaſe the cruel <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loch</hi> and the fierce <hi>Cerberus</hi> with ſome Morſel or other, that may ſatisfy his Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous indignation; all which miſerable Superſtition, and miſtakes in Religion, which were ſo Notorious in the Heathen
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60245:30"/>World, and not quite got out of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, are for ever prevented by this clear and firm Principle, That God is a Being truly Righteous himſelf, and that he neither loves nor hates others, but as they are, or are not ſo; for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs excludes both partial fondneſs and unreaſonable diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It makes all Religion to be a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Arbitrary thing, and takes off from its intrinſick Worth and Excellency, as having no Foundation in the real good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of what is commanded, nor in the Nature of God, but only in his Arbitrary Will and Pleaſure. Whereas this it is, that truly commends Religion to the Minds of conſidering Men, that it is the obliging us to ſuch Laws as are Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Unalterably Good, from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things; which do naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce good Effects to our ſelves and the World, and are the neceſſary cauſes of our happineſs, and that therefore God has laid them upon us, not as a Yoke he would have us ſubmit to, meerly becauſe we ought to be ſubject to him, but as they are good in themſelves, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means of our. Happineſs: that his Commands are but the Copies of his own Original and wiſe Reaſon, the Tranſcript of his own Eternal Righteouſneſs and Perfections; and that the Righteouſneſs
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60245:30"/>he Commands us, is taken from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and is a lively Pattern and Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar of his own Nature, and Eſſential Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>This does extremely commend Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Righteouſneſs to us, that 'tis not only founded in the Will, but the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God too, and is not only inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven with the very make of our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, but derived from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Perfections of God, as the Fountain of it; that 'tis not an imperious reſtraint upon us from humourſom and boundleſs Will, that had no antecedent Reaſon thus to limit and confine us; but that all the Laws of Righteouſneſs, beſides the Stamp and Impreſs that Heaven has fixt upon them, are of intrinſick Worth and Value, and that their own goodneſs is the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſanction and the trueſt reaſon of their obligation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The having ſuch a Conception of God, is very diſhonourable to God, and uncomfortable to our ſelves, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider no other effects of it upon our lives; 'tis a robbing him of one of the Nobleſt Perfections of his Nature, of the richeſt Jewels of his Crown: and the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent Juſtice and Righteouſneſs are the greateſt Excellencies of a Governor, of a great and powerful Being, and his power without thoſe will be only a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60245:31"/>miſchief. There is nothing that all Men do more admire and commend than impartial Juſtice in thoſe who are above them, becauſe 'tis a guard and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every Man, a fence ſet about him and all his Intereſts, and nothing is more manifeſt than the influence which Juſtice has upon the good of the World; ſo that every body when he thinks on a <hi>Cato</hi> or an <hi>Ariſtides</hi> bleſſes him in his heart, and ſpeaks well of him with his Lips. And what we think ſuch a Perfection in men and ſuch an object of Eſteem there, if we deny it to God, we ſtop one of the main ſtreams of Honour, that ſhould flow from him, and cut off the brighteſt Ray of the Divine Luſtre: neither can we give that Honour that belongs to him, if we ſtrip him of thoſe Perfections, any more than we can ſee the Sun, if we diſrobe it of its Light, or admire the face that we have mangled and deformed: There muſt be ſuch a congruity in the Object, like Charms ſitted to attract our Paſſions, and excite our Eſteem, or elſe we can no more love and honour than we can taſte with our Eyes, and ſee with our Palate: and mere Power is no more an object of Love and Honour, but as 'tis an Inſtrument to do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60245:31"/>never bring us heartily to Honour and Eſteem it. We ſhall dread ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as has us under, and can cruſh us as he pleaſes, juſt as a little Bird does the Eagle, when its Claws are upon it; and we ſhall live in as much terror and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and uncertain deſtractions of mind from ſuch thoughts of God, as a Slave does under his Mercileſs Patron, who knows not what hardſhip he ſhall ſuffer next, whether he ſhall be Sold, or Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or Murdered. If when we know that his Power is Abſolute and Irreſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and have no ſecurity from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Nature, that he ſhall not uſe it to rack and torture us, and do us miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief unleſs we do that which Juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves it; we may then be glad if we could with the <hi>Epicureans,</hi> free our minds from the melancholy thoughts of ſuch a Cruel and Over-ruling <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> and muſt never hope to come to perfect Eaſe, and Tranquility, and repoſe of Mind, till we had got rid of the ſears of ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible <hi>Mormo.</hi> But God forbid that this ſhould be the caſe of Mankind; no 'tis the moſt equal and impartial Juſtice that rules the World, that Adminiſters all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with the greateſt Juſtice and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, whom we have no reaſon to dread, unleſs we do baſe and wicked things, that diſorder and do miſchief: then indeed he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60245:32"/>will ſeverely Chaſtiſe and Puniſh us, but elſe there is not the ſeverity or injuſtice or hard uſage that we need ever fear from him, no more than a Child from the moſt indulgent Parent, or a Subject from the beſt natured Prince and Governor. There was never in all his vaſt Kingdom and Empire of the World, in all his long and laſting Government, any the leaſt Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs that could ever be charged upon it, nor has any, the meaneſt Perſon, reaſon to complain of any the leaſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice done it, nor ever ſhall have; which is the third and laſt Particular.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To Vindicate the Righteouſneſs of God, according to this true account of it, and clear it from what either in this Chapter, or any where elſe, may ſeem to reflect upon it, which will be great eaſe to our minds, and confirm what has been aſſerted before: and this I ſhall do by laying down briefly two or three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that will meet with almoſt all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and all objections about this matter, for I muſt not deſcend now to Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Arbitrary and Unlimited good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is no inſtance of Unrighteouſneſs, as if a Prince think fit to ſhow extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Favours to ſome of his Subjects more than others, to raiſe them to higher Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Preſerments, or to give them ſome

And this was the caſe in this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Chapter, of God's beſtowing the Privileges of the Goſpel, and Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the Gentiles, rather than the <hi>Jews; As the Gentiles, which followed not after Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, have attained to Righteouſneſs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Righteouſneſs that is of Faith, but</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which followed after the Law of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, hath not attained to the Law of Righteouſneſs,</hi> v. 30.31. tho that was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their own Fault: And this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the <hi>Jews</hi> had no reaſon to diſallow, who had before reapt ſo much benefit by it; it being the only ground why God was more gracious to them, than the reſt of the World, and that he ſtill allows ſome Perſons and Countries much greater means of Grace than others, tho' there are none who want what is ſufficient for them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That God, as abſolute Lord, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor and Creator of the World, has ſo vaſt a Right over his Creatures, as to put 'em into what condition he pleaſes, that is not worſe than the having no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60245:33"/>for that is but giving 'em a leſſer good. But to put them into ſuch a ſtate as it were deſirable rather to be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, than to be ſo miſerable; to do this without ſome fault of theirs that ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this as a puniſhment, is againſt the plaineſt Axioms and Rules of Right and Juſtice, and is to take more from a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, than he gives it, and ſo make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as it were a debtor to it. There can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any ſuch thing as unlimited Right, no, not in God over his Creatures, for all Right ſuppoſes ſome Rules to bound and limit it, the tranſgreſſing of which may be ſuppoſed, and therefore may be wrong and injury, and here is the <gap reason="foreign">

That puniſhment and ſeverity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſinners, which is neceſſary for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, and for the Ends of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is not to be called Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, be it never ſo great: and I can never believe that God does ever inflict more, no, not in the Eternal torments of Hell, nor has any other end in that, or any other puniſhment and ſeverity, than to give a ſufficient ſanction to his Laws; than wiſely to Govern, and keep the world in order, and procure with the beſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, the Welfare and Happineſs of all the Beings that are in it; and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever puniſhments are neceſſary to that end are upon that account Juſt and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; ſince that is the only true meaſure by which a Juſt proportion can be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the fault and the puniſhment. I know not what they mean who talk of any ſort of Vindictive Juſtice in God different from this, as if there were any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengefull Paſſion in him to be ſatisfied by the miſeries of his Creatures, or he took any other pleaſure in the puniſhment of them, but meerly the pleaſure of doing Juſtice; 'ris this is a further aſſurance to us of Gods Righteouſneſs, that a Being ſo great and powerfull and ſelf ſufficient, can have no ſuch paſſions as ſpring up in weak and impotent minds, nor be tempted to do any injuſtice becauſe that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60245:34"/>proceeds always from weakneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity.</p>
               <p>But I muſt enlarge no further on theſe particulars, I hope what has been ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready will give ſome ſatisfaction to our minds, that there is no Unrighteouſneſs in the great God. But he that is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Great, is therefore infinitely Juſt and Righteous, becauſe he can have no Mean and Unrighteous deſigns, either for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or againſt others, ſo that Juſtice and Righteouſneſs is neceſſarily joined with Almighty Power, and it muſt be a thought full of dread and horror that can conceive it poſſible to have them parted and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated; but in Truth, where there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one infinite Perfection there muſt be all, and therefore we have the ſame Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from reaſon of Gods being Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, as of his being Almighty, or of his being at all; and they who from ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken places of Scripture and Revelation endeavour to Repreſent God under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notion and Character, deſtroy that true natural Notion and Conception of a God, upon which all Revelation is built, and which muſt be previous and ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to it; and make Religion, and the thoughts of a God, which is the moſt cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and comfortable thing in the World, to be an hideouſly black and melancholy Superſtition; and as this may reaſonably

               <p>OUR Bleſſed Saviour in the foregoing verſes, was exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all Perſons to embrace his Religion, who were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any load and Burthen, Trouble, and uneaſineſs of Mind, and he promiſes to give them eaſe and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Come unto me allye that Labour and are heavy Laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi>

               <p>This is a great Undertaking and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and very deſirable and inviting to Mankind. The Diſeaſes and Diſorders and Uneaſineſſes of the Mind, are a great many more than thoſe of the Body, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60245:36"/>it is a more Divine thing and more ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Gods as <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeaks, to find out proper Phyſick and Remedies to Cure them than the other; Our Saviour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes his Religion and his Example, as the means to do this, <hi>Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me.</hi> There were a great many Sects of Philoſophers of old, in which the wiſeſt Men always aimed at this Tranquility and eaſe of Mind, and propoſed their Doctrine as the way to attain it, and gave admirable Rules of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving up to ſuch heights of Vertue, as ſhould make Men caſie and happy in all conditions, even the worſt that could befall them; and a great many of them it muſt be confeſſed were as great Examples, as Teachers of theſe, ſuch as <hi>Pythagoras, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Plato, Zeno,</hi> and others, who were the natural Prophets and Apoſtles of the Heathen World, and taught 'em the beſt Wiſdom and Vertue, and the beſt Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons how to attain the trueſt and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt happineſs, they knew humane Nature to be capable of. Revelation, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Religion of Chriſt, has done the ſame with much greater advantage; hath ſhown us a right Notion of Happineſs, and all that conduces to it, and has both enlarged the view and proſpect of it in another World, and improved the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of acquiring and obtaining it, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60245:36"/>confirmed that good old Notion, that it lies only in Vertue, that nothing elſe can make a Man happy, and this alone can do it. Our Saviour as well as moſt of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers were to all appearance none of the happieſt men in the World, they were poor and mean and deſpiſed and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and had very little or none of thoſe things, in which the World places Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, Riches and Honours, and Pleaſures, which we ſo fondly admire and eſteem and purſue after, as the happieſt things that are to be enjoyed, and think thoſe are not in earneſt or only envious and ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur'd becauſe they cannot attain them, who ſpeak otherwiſe of them. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour propoſes no Worldly advantages to his followers, but rather the quite contrary, and yet he Preaches happineſs to them even at preſent, and joyns the Beatitudes and the Chriſtian Vertues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in his Sermon, as inſeparable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; and tho' he left his Apoſtles in a World full of afflictions and ſeeming mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, yet he tells them, he leaves his Peace with them, <hi>John</hi> 14.27. Such a Peace as was proper for him to give and them to receive, not as the World giveth, but ſuch an one as ſhould have this effect upon them, as that their hearts ſhould not be troubled nor be afraid, that no evils ſhould diſturb or take away this Peace of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60245:37"/>mind, that in him they might have Peace, tho' in the World they had tribulation, <hi>John</hi> 16.33. and that they might always be of good cheer becauſe he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome the World. 'Tis a great thing which he here offers to Mankind, be they never ſo weary and oppreſs'd with cares, and troubles, labour under never ſo many ſeeming evils and afflictions here, have never ſuch great loads and oppreſſions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Minds and Spirits, that make them uneaſie to themſelves, and very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable within; that if they come to his Religion, and take his Yoke upon them, follow the Rules and precepts of his Doctrine, and become of ſuch a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſpirit as he was, that they ſhall certainly meet with eaſe and comfort, relief, and refreſhment, <hi>And ye ſhall ſind reſt to your Souls.</hi> This Reſt and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of Mind is the greateſt Happineſs in the World; what Philoſophy aimed and purſued after, what we ſhould endeavour to attain above every thing, and what if we once perfectly reach, nothing could ever make us the leaſt miſerable; what alone is worth ſeeking after, by all the Rules of Philoſophy and Religion, and without which, nothing is worth aiming or ſeeking after, and laſtly what Chriſt and Chriſtianity propoſe, and can bring us to.</p>

               <p>How and by what ways they do it, or what is the beſt means to attain it, ſhall be my chief buſineſs to ſhew; as to what it is, or wherein it conſiſts, that we know better by inward ſenſation or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, than by any deſcription or Ideas of it; we feel what eaſe is both in Mind and Body, and we have a quick Senſe of pain and uneaſineſs in both; Indolency of Body, and Tranquility of Mind, are known by all to be great and deſirable things. The pleaſures of our compounded nature, and ſuch as have a near Analogy and Reſemblance with one another, however we are forced to expreſs and deſcribe one by the other, they are not meer Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, ſuch as ſuppoſe only no Senſe of pain or evil, which may belong to one that is aſleep or ſtupified, or to a Stock or a Stone: but a poſitive Senſe of what is agreeble to its Nature and the right uſe of its powers and faculties, and an Enjoyment or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a good or Pleaſure, ſuitable to them, with an intire freedom at the ſame time from what is contrary and unagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, painfull and troubleſome and unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. The very abſence of what is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and uneaſie, brings a great pleaſure, becauſe Nature then enjoys it ſelf, and has its own ſuitable perceptions without any diſturbance. What Diſeaſes and Pains and Tortures are to the Body, the ſame are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60245:38"/>diſorders and troubles to the mind, from tormenting paſſions and uneaſie Thoughts; from Fear, and Guilt, and Sorrow, the apprehenſion of evil as preſent, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it; we want words to expreſs what we know and conceive of this: and Peace of mind is oppoſed to all things that weary and diſeaſe, and diſquiet and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb it whatever they are, whether the Evils and Troubles and Afflictions of this World, or Paſſions and Diſorders from within, inordinate and irregular Deſires and inward Commotions contrary to right Reaſon, or the more dreadfull terrors and horrors of ſome greater evil than any in this World.

                  </gap> Pain by theſe, than the Body from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Diſeaſe. The Diſeaſes and Maladies, Diſorders and Pains of the mind, are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and harder to be cured, than thoſe of the Body. Wiſdom, and Philoſophy, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion, are the proper Phyſick, the true Cure and Remedy of them, the only things that can bring the mind to that Good, Sound, and Healthfull State, that it ſhall be well and rightly diſpoſed in it; due Frame and Craſis, ſitted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form its proper Operations, and enjoy its agreeable Pleaſures; the Pleaſure and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of its ſelf, and its own Wife, and Vertuous, and good Thoughts, the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60245:38"/>pleaſant Hopes and Expectations of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and all the ſuperadded Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from thence, that Revelation aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us of; beſides what are natural to it from the right Exerciſe of its own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſuch as Peace of Conſcience upon Pardon of Sin, inward Senſe of God's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or his lifting up the light of his Countenance upon us, Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, and rejoycing in hope of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that ſhall be revealed: Theſe are ſuch Pleaſures and Enjoyments of Mind, as are beyond Nature, but within Chriſtianity, which raiſe and exalt the Soul to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond that Tranquility and Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Serenity of Mind which Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy ſo talkt of. This improves it high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and raiſes a more noble ſtructure of Happineſs to our Souls, but upon the ſame Foundation, having the ſame Bottom to build upon, the inward Eaſe and Peace and reſt of the Mind, which is the greateſt thing we can deſire, or is worth our attaining.</p>
               <p>To be very eaſy always within, to have Peace and Quiet in our own Breaſts, to be diſturbed with no uneaſie Thoughts, no tumultuous Paſſions, no Fear, Grief, or Sorrow, no carking Care, or corroding Trouble; to be rufled with no diſcompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, have no dark Clouds hanging over our Thoughts, no Storms or Tempeſts ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging within our Breaſts; this is Tranquility
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60245:39"/>of Mind an inward Calm, and Serenity of Thoughts, contrary to that Temper of mind, <hi>Which is like the troubled Sea, which cannot reſt,</hi> to which the Scripture compares it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20. neither apt to be much rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed or too much depreſſed, <hi>Nec attollens ſe unquam, nec deprimens,</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Sed ſemper aequali, &amp; placido ſtatu,</hi> always even and in a placid ſtate, <hi>propitius ſibi, &amp; ſua laetus aſpiciens,</hi> pleaſed with its ſelf and its own thoughts, and having nothing to ſowre and diſorder it ſelf, or infuſe a poyſonous bitterneſs into it. This is that good ſtate of Soul, that reſt which is a greater Happineſs than all the World can afford, which he that has, will be Happy in whatever Circumſtances or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he is, and which we might cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find by Religion and Chriſtianity, if we lived up to the Principles and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of it; <hi>Take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, and ye ſhall find reſt to your Souls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall premiſe a few cautions to prevent any miſtake in this matter, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſtate and explain it.</p>
               <p>Then ſhow how we may by the help and means of Religion, attain to this Reſt, Peace, and Tranquility of Mind.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then, I do not pretend that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Virtue, will ſet Men free from all the evils of this World, and be a protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt any manner of outward Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60245:39"/>or Calamities ever falling upon us; This cannot be, <hi>For Man is born to Trouble as the Sparks fly upwards, Job</hi> 5.7. They are a great many of them natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and unavoidable, and God muſt alter the nature of Things and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the World, and work perpetual Miracles to free us always from them; to have our Bodies ſubject to no Diſeaſes and Indiſpoſitions, our Eſtates ſubject to no Loſſes and Caſualities, or Children or Friends not ſubject to Death, or to be taken away from us, this is impoſſible, and what no good Man muſt expect; that the Rain or Drought ſhould not ſometimes ſpoil his Corn, the Sea ſhipwrack his Goods or Veſſel, the Fire burn his Houſe as well as anothers: theſe common misfortunes which happen alike to all, and a great many Loſſes from the fraud and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of others, as well as abundance of natural evils ariſing from the Mechaniſm of our ſelves and the World; theſe the moſt Virtuous cannot expect to be exempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from, but like Travellers through this World, they muſt all paſs thro' the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Road with others, and ſometimes meet with bad and unpleaſant way, and now and then with a ſhower that may fall upon 'em: but the Religious Man is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever much better provided againſt thoſe, againſt the common and unavoidable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60245:40"/>of life, than another who is but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſubject to them; his Mind is Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt all the darts of Fortune, and they ſhall not enter ſo deep, nor ſmart ſo grievouſly as to the wicked; he has ſomething within to ſupport him under all the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Afflictions of this World, a good God, a good Conſcience, and a good Proſpect, and Hopes of Heaven, when a wicked Man has none of thoſe to keep him up, but muſt wholly ſink and fall under them. The one will have the Peace of his Mind, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort within, that ſhall pour Oyl and Balſam into all the Wounds of Fortune and make Afflictions more eaſie and tolerable; but the other will increaſe the ſmart of them, by his wickedneſs, that will then lie heavier upon him, when his Spirit is oppreſſed with other troubles, the load of thoſe and of his ſins both will be inſupportable to him, and when his mind is ſore by its inward guilt, every hard thing from without, will more pinch and gall him. A good Man may keep this Peace of Mind under any Worldly afflictions, but a bad Man cannot.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither will Religion make all things equal as to the outward Happineſs of this life, ariſing from Mens different States and Conditions and unequal Circumſtances in this World. It may be allowed that there is a proper and real good, in the Plenty, Riches, and Conveniences of life, and that a good
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60245:40"/>Man is not quite ſo happy that wants them, as if he had 'em; but they might be an acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a ſmall Addition to his more true and greater Happineſs of Vertue, tho' that be infinitely more Great and Valuable and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, yet I do not know that Religion takes away or diſallows the other; we may therefore both Lawfully Deſire and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make our outward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in this World as good, and eaſie, and comfortable as we can, within the bounds of Vertue, and 'tis both Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Lawful to do it; and it borders, I doubt, upon Hypocriſie or Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to pretend the contrary, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways confuted by a contrary Deſire and Practice in thoſe who have talked other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But ſtill a good Man can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented and eaſie in a very mean and ſtrait Condition, if Providence allots this to him; and he will not Diſquiet or Diſturb him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for what he ſees others enjoy, if God ſees not ſit for him to have them: and tho he can allow a leſſer good and a proper uſe and conveniency, and ſome ſmall Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs perhaps as to this life, to belong to thoſe outward things in reſpect of the Wants and Neceſſities, and the State we are in here, which made <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> put the <hi>Externa Bona</hi> into the Ingredients of compleat Happineſs; yet he can be very Happy with a few of thoſe
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60245:41"/>as knowing that <hi>Man's Life conſiſteth not in abundance,</hi> as Chriſt ſays, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.15. and that a few things will ſuffice na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and having Food and Raiment, which is the Apoſtles, as well as Natures competency, he can be content and make up a Happineſs to himſelf out of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more eſſential Parts and Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of it, to wit, Vertue and Wiſdom, and a good Mind, without thoſe Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages and Ornaments, Trimmings, and Garniſhings of it, which we call outward Happineſs and Proſperity. I am not for maintaining that Stoical Paradox, That a virtuous Man was thereby Rich, and a King, and every thing that's Great: They might as well have ſaid alſo, he is always Strong and Healthfull, tho 'tis plain, he may be both Sickly and Poor; and his greateſt Virtues may take away neither of thoſe evils, and their contraries may be allowed to be both goods in a lower Sence and ſo Deſir'd by us: but he will be Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a Thouſand times without thoſe, than without his Vertue; they can never make him truly Happy without that, but he may be Happy without thoſe, by the Peace and Comfort, the Firmneſs and Goodneſs of his own Mind, altho' if he had them too, they might add ſomething to his preſent Happineſs and Good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, this I will not Cynically deny. Nor yet,</p>

               <p n="3">3. That Religion will quite alter his bodily Temper, any more than his World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Circumſtances, but a good Man may labour under an unhappy Temper, and ill Craſis, and Diſpoſition of Blood and Humours: His Wiſe and Vertuous Soul may <hi>male habitare,</hi> be lodged not only in a Deformed, but a Sickly, and Unhealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or otherwiſe ill-framed Body; A natural Sulphur and Choler may lodge in his Blood, that may be too apt to Fire and heat him, or too much dull and heavy Phlegm, may clog his Spirits, and make them Liſtleſs and Unactive, and not riſe to Warmth, and fervor in his Religious Duties; the Salts that keep the Humours from putrefying may make them too Sharp or Sowre, and apt to make a Temper too Fretfull and Peeviſh; or a black melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Humour may be thus produced and become Predominant that will diſorder the Spirits, and fill the Head and other Parts with dark Vapours, and irregular Ferments, and draw a Cloud of Darkneſs and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolateneſs over the Brain, and even the Soul it ſelf. Now Religion will not, nor cannot cure this any more than any other Bodily Diſeaſes, and he that is afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, muſt bear them, as he would the Gout or Stone, or any other Diſeaſe that is incident to us; but ſince theſe affect the Mind more, and the Mind alſo by its

                  </gap> thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Humours and Temperaments of Body; for all Anger and Firſt, and the other Bodily Paſſions that are ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome both to our ſelves and others, ariſe from them. The Soul is the ſame in all Men, not more inclined to any of thoſe Paſſions by its Original make and nature, than the contrary; they all ariſe from our Body, and our lower Nature, and are the reſults of that, and therefore they are in Brutes, we often ſee, as well as Men: but the Soul by being Vitally united to the Body, has a Preception and Senſation of them, and ſuch thoughts are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily cauſed in it by them. Now neither the firſt motions of the Body, nor firſt thoughts of the Soul upon them are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, becauſe they are both neceſſary, but the Soul has a Power within it ſelf, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to conſent, or not conſent to theſe Bodily Motions and Inclinations, which we call Paſſions; and this Principle of the Soul, we call the Will, I do not mean a power to conſent to their firſt riſing, or not riſing in us, that is often neceſſary and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60245:42"/>unavoidable, and ſo not within the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Soul, but perfectly unvolunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but then whether it ſhall continue ſuch a thought, that is excited upon ſuch a Paſſion, at leaſt continue it ſo far as to approve and like it, and conſent to it, and put it into Act if it can, and actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly execute it, and let it produce any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and laſting Effects; this is in the power of the Soul, and herein lies the great Exerciſe of its Virtues, in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſubduing the Paſſions, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the carnal Luſts and Bodily In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; if it yields to thoſe ſo as to commit any Unlawfull Actions, or any ſin in purſuance of them, then it ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fills the Luſts of the Fleſh, and walks af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fleſh, and is carnal, and <hi>carnally minded,</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s phraſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. <hi>but if thro' the Spirit,</hi> and by help of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>it does mortify theſe deeds of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it ſhall live,</hi> v. 13. If it ſuffer no ſin to reign in its mortal Body, nor give way to thoſe Paſſions and Luſts, ſo as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin by them, but with the greateſt care and pains keep them within the bounds of Reaſon and Religion, then it does <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſie the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts, Galat.</hi> 5.24. not that they muſt become quite dead and extinct, ſo that we feel no motions of them: no; they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the beſt and moſt regenerate Man,

Now Religion is ſo to Govern, and keep under all theſe Paſſions and bodily inclinations, that they run not into Sin, but it cannot quite cut them up and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate them; it is to improve and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Nature by Grace, but not to deſtroy it: Theſe Paſſions therefore, cauſed by thoſe Bodily Humours and Tempers which we are naturally inclined to; theſe which are one of the greateſt cauſes of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and diſorders of the mind, and which bring the greateſt Uneaſineſs and Pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to it, and rob it of that Evenneſs and Calmneſs, and Tranquility, which is the great Happineſs of it: theſe Religion cannot ſo wholly remove and take away as that we ſhould be perfectly free from them, and from all the motions and riſings of them; but it will and muſt ſo far ſubdue and conquer them, as that they neither have Sinful and Unlawful Effects upon others, nor ſo far diſorder our ſelves, as to ſpoil and deſtroy the Peace, and Reſt, and Quiet of our minds. I do not mean that they ſhould never diſturb us, for ſo they will a little, as often as we feel them; but not to that degree, as to take away the Peace and Tranquillity of our mind,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60245:43"/>and to deſtroy the habit and temper of it; if they do, we can never be Happy with them. How Religion cures them, and to what degree, it muſt overcome them, I ſhall conſider afterwards; at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I ſhall only obſerve that Religion does not wholly deſtroy and root them up, nor alter our bodily Temper and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; but a good Man ſtill lies open to the firſt motions of Anger, Peeviſhneſs, Melancholy, and the like, and may never be quite otherwiſe, any more than alter his Complexion, or his Stature, and make his Hair White or black: but he may have Peace in his Mind, and Reſt in his Soul, notwithſtanding that in the ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Frame, and Habit, and Temper of it, founded upon the Hopes and Principles of Religion, theſe are troubleſome and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to him, and will alſo affect his Mind, as well as any other bodily Pain and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; but yet his Reſt and Tranquility, may be conſiſtent with both thoſe: for 'tis a rational intellectual Senſe and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the Soul, which depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Principles and Rules, and not upon mere Temper and Mechaniſm of body; for then ill Weather, as well as an ill body would alter and deſtroy it.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:60245:44"/>
               <p>I come now to ſhow how we may attain it, which is the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing of all, and when we have if, we ſhall better underſtand it, than by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other account of it; like Health we know what it is, tho' we cannot ſo well deſcribe it, and like eaſe and pleaſure, we can beſt Judge of it by feeling it: 'Tis as <hi>Tully</hi> calls it, <hi>ſanitas animi,</hi> the Health and Soundneſs and good Temper of the Soul, and when the Soul wants it, it is Sick and under a Diſeaſe, in Pain and Diſorder. We all know how good and ſweet a thing health and eaſe is both of Body and Mind, ſo that there need not many words to commend them; how to get it, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, and recover it when it is loſt, is the greateſt Queſtion.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour here tells us we may <hi>find reſt to our Souls,</hi> and obtain this Peace and Tranquility of mind. I ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what the means are, and by what ways Religion does effect this in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Religion teaches us that Happineſs lies chiefly in our Mind, that that is the proper ſeat of it, and that it lies not in things without us, but is a Treaſure in our own Breaſts, ſomething within ourſelves, which belongs to our Souls, and conſiſts in the Perfection, Improvement and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them; this is in other words
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60245:44"/>called the Salvation of the Soul, reſtoring it to its loſt Happineſs, and freeing it from the Miſeries and Evils that ſin brought upon it. 'Tis the great and proper buſineſs of Religion, to ſave the Soul or make it Happy, which is done by making it Wiſe and Vertuous, by raiſing it to its trueſt Perfection, by improving it with Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Habits and Diſpoſitions, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to a Godlike, Heavenly Frame and Diſpoſition, and ſo cultivating, and fitting it for the greateſt Enjoyment of God and Eternal Happineſs.</p>
               <p>Religion puts us upon this one thing needfull, and its whole Scope and Deſign is to Cure and Mend, to Perfect and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Soul, to Convert and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and Regenerate and Inlighten the Mind; which are words that import the making it wiſe and good, becauſe in this lies our true and proper Happineſs, in the Moral ſtate and Gracious temper, and Diſpoſition of the Mind, and in ſuch a Perfection and Enjoyment of it, as is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Religion. They who think Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs lies in bodily Pleaſures, or outward Enjoyments, do at the ſame time, leave Religion, and miſtake Happineſs. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion bids us moderate all Carnal and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enjoyments, and mortifie all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes and Immoderate deſires and degrees of them, and takes off as far as may be
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60245:45"/>our natural Love and Affections to them; and will by no means allow us to place our Happineſs in them, as being poor and empty, ſhort and tranſient things, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the more true, and greater, and inward Happineſs of our own Minds. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion bids us mind that, and thoſe things in which it conſiſts, take care of our Souls and the means of improving them in Grace and Vertue, and the freeing them from thoſe Vices and ill Tempers, and Habits, that will Deſtroy, and make them Miſeia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>A Mans Happineſs or Miſery, even his Eternal one, is founded in his own Mind, and depends upon the good or bad Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and Diſpoſition of it: for the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the Soul is like the Health of the Body, ſomething within it ſelf, and conſiſts in the Vigour and right Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of all its Faculties and its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Powers, and, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> obſerves, a Gouty Foot is not cured by a rich Shoe, nor the Head-ach took off by a Crown or Diadem, nor an ill Mind made Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, by any thing without it; while it is ſick and uneaſie within, it will be Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, tho' it hath every thing elſe; for Happineſs lies in our Minds, and within our ſelves; and Religion, by teaching us this, and being concerned wholly to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and improve our Minds, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60245:45"/>it ſelf wholly to them, is very help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to bring us to it; for it thereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us where it lies, and takes us off from all falſe ſcents and purſuits of it, and from all vain opinions and imaginations about it. To know the true ſeat of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and where it lies, in what it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and wherein it conſiſts, is one of the beſt means to attain it, and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to prevent all miſtakes and wandring Queſts and unprofitable Searches after it, which almoſt all Men are guilty of, by Imagining it lies in other things, and in things without 'em, and not, as it truly does, in their own Minds, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> ſays; wherefore ſince the Fountain of this Reſt and Tranquility of Mind, is in our ſelves, let us take care to keep clean and purifie that.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Religion teaches us the trueſt and beſt Wiſdom, which is the Foundation of this Tranquility of Mind; for 'tis ſome Folly or other, ſome weak Thought or Paſſion, vain Fancy or Opinion, and the want of a true Underſtanding, and the rightly uſing our Reaſon, or making true Judgment of things, that is always the cauſe of the Diſorder and Diſturbance, and Indiſpoſition of Mind. Says <hi>Tully,</hi> The Fountain of all perturbations is a Defection from right Reaſon, ſomething
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60245:46"/>which does excite turbid motions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and oppoſite to Reaſon; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his Excellent Diſcourſe on this Subject he calls Wiſdom, <hi>Sanitas animi, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipientia autem eſt quaſi inſanitas quaedam, quae eſt inſania, eademque dementia:</hi> Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the Health and Sanity of Mind, and Folly is its Unſoundneſs, and what puts it out of order. And he calls this good ſtate we are ſpeaking of, <hi>ſanitatem animorum poſitam in tranquillitate quadam, conſtantiaque.</hi> Now Religion teaches the Mind the trueſt Wiſdom, and cures it of the greateſt Follies that are incident to it; it directs it to have right Thoughts, and to make Judgment of things; propoſes to it the beſt end, and the ſureſt means to attain it; ſhows it what is its chief Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and its Principal Intereſt, and puts a right value and eſtimate upon things according to their worth and deſert, and thereby frees the Mind from all wrong Opinions and Imaginations, which are apt. to make it Vitious as well as Diſorderly; for all Vice is founded upon falſe Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and want of right Judging of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, whereby they imagine ſuch Actions to be good and agreeable; and that they ſhall be Happy in having ſuch Pleaſures and Enjoyments, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying ſuch Luſts and Deſires, but they and themſelves Miſtaken and Deceived,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60245:46"/>and therefore vext and troubled, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their own Folly one time or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo plainly confeſs and accuſe themſelves of having done a weak and ſilly thing, what their wiſer thoughts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but condemn; and what appears now to be contrary to right Reaſon, would Men live up to that, which ſhould be the deſign of a Wiſe Man, and what his Reaſon was given him for, and what makes him live above Brutes and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals of meer Senſe, and lower Paſſions: we ſhould never be uneaſie or diſturbed or unquiet in our Minds, we ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways approve of what we do, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied from our ſelves as the Wiſe Man ſpeaks; we ſhould live by Principles that would always ſupport and bear us up, and let nothing ſink or deject us; we ſhould never do a Weak, a Raſh or a Fooliſh thing, that we repented of and were ſorry for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; we ſhould act ſteadily and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, by the certain Rules of Wiſdom and Vertue, and not be ſo uncertain and mutable in our Thoughts and Actings, which cauſes great diſquietude and une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venneſs, and diſorder in our Minds. Were we but as wiſe as Religion would make us, we ſhould have very little to diſturb us; Religion is what teaches us the beſt Wiſdom, and if rightly underſtood, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves us from the greateſt follies and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60245:47"/>weakneſſes of humane nature; and true Wiſdom is the Foundation of Peace and Tranquility of Mind, which is always loſt, and deſtroyed by ſome folly or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to right Reaſon and true Wiſdom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Religion teaches us not to place our Happineſs in any outward things of this World, for if we do, we ſhall find Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs is not in our power, and that we cannot always reach or attain it; for things here will often fall out croſs and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our deſires and wiſhes, and there are a thouſand Accidents to hinder and diſappoint us of our Worldly aims; and we muſt be often very uneaſie, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry miſerable, if our meer miſſing of them makes us ſo: and if we could attain them, and become maſters of them, we ſhould yet find our ſelves diſappointed, and ſhould not meet with that Happineſs that we expected from them. Had we all we could wiſh for or deſire in this World, yet we ſhould not find that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and compleat Enjoyment we imagined before-hand in any condition; for thus Experience convinces us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces all Mankind, that there is ſtill ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting to make us Happy, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we enjoy of this World; and how much ſoever we have of it, there is ſo much emptineſs in all the things of it, ſo much mixture and allay of evil with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60245:47"/>good; it is ſo unagreeable to the larger capacities of our Souls, and ſo ſhort of filling and ſatisfying them, that <hi>Solomon</hi> pronounced of all Worldly things that they were <hi>Vanity and Vexation of Spirit, Eccleſ.</hi> 1.14. and this is not a Philoſophical rant or a diſcontented Reflection, or an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical ſaying; but a ſtrict and certain truth, founded upon the beſt Experience, and the wiſeſt Obſervation of things; for no Man whoever ſet his Heart upon the things of this World, found that content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and full ſatisfaction in them that he expected, but met with more cares and troubles in the purſuing them, than they were worth, and pierced himſelf through with a great many ſorrows and anxieties, by being over deſirous of them: and if he gained them with all his labour and toil, yet was as far from true Happineſs as before; for as the Prophet elegantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it, <hi>The Bed is ſhorter than that a Man can ſtretch himſelf on it, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering narrower than that he can wrap him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it, Iſa.</hi> 28.20. Worldly things are too narrow, ſhort, and imperfect, and are no way fitted to make us compleatly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; ſomething will ſtill be wanting that we call good, and ſome evil will be preſent and mixed with what we enjoy, that will allay and embitter it. To ſeek for Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this World is to ſeek for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60245:48"/>among the dead; It is not here, it is riſen, it is above; it is only in Heaven and in God, and Religion, and to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed no where elſe. Religion raiſes our Minds to a nobler and truer Happineſs than any in this World, and it helps us to as good degrees of it, as we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of at preſent; by taking off our hopes and deſires, and expectations of it, as to Worldly things, and curing us of too much concern and anxiety about them, and making us indifferent and caſie, and contented whatever our preſent Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are in this World. Which is the</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourth thing by which it procures and affords this eaſe and tranquility of Mind that we are ſpeaking of. Moſt of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſſes of life, are cauſed by a ſollicitude about Worldly things, proceeding from an immoderate love, and an over great Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of them, as if our Happineſs lay in poſſeſſing a great abundance of them. This is the root of that Covetouſneſs and Ambition, which make us inordinately deſire Riches and Honours, which two are very reſtleſs and uneaſy. Vices, and fill our lives with infinite Trouble and Diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and make our Minds always Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie and Diſcontented. He is a very Happy Man, who is eaſie and ſatisfied in his preſent Circumſtances, and has <hi>learnt</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:60245:48"/>with St. <hi>Paul, in whatſoever ſtate he is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be content, Phil.</hi> 4.11. who hath made ſuch true Judgment of Worldly things, that he has no great Opinion of them, nor does admire or think there is very much in them: but having the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and Accommodations of life, can eat of his own little morſel, and drink out of his own Brook, with as much Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Satisfaction as if he were to take from the greateſt Heap, or drink of the greateſt River, or be Entertained with all the Luxurious Plenty, and Ambitious State of the Rich and Great ones, who with all their Enjoyments have a Thouſand times more trouble and uneaſineſſes than the other in a more moderate condition. For 'tis certain, the way to Contentment and Happineſs, is rather to abate our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, than to fill 'em; and the more we raiſe and heighten theſe, the more uneaſie we ſhall always be. Vain Opinion and weak Imagination ſet a falſe value and eſtimate upon the outward differences a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men; but I doubt not but they may be all equally Happy, and that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has diſtributed good and evil with a more equal and impartial hand than we imagine, and that thoſe of low condition enjoy as much Happineſs in this World, as thoſe of the higheſt: The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is not made by Circumſtances, but
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60245:49"/>by temper of Mind, and by keeping our deſires within moderate bounds, and not being anxious, or ſollicitous, or uneaſie for what we do not enjoy; but in being contented and well pleaſed with whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Providence allots to us: when we bring our ſelves to this, we ſhall be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and happy and free our ſelves from thoſe immoderate deſires, carking cares and anxious ſollicitudes about the things of this World, which pierce us through with a Thouſand ſorrows, and deſtroy the Eaſe and Tranquility of our Minds. Now to do this we muſt be taught and convinced by Religion, that Happineſs lies not in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, and be cured of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weak Fancy and Opinion that makes us ſo immoderately deſire 'em, and be ſo anxiouſly concerned about 'em, to the loſs even of that Reſt and Peace of Mind, that we might otherwiſe have without them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Religion teaches us to govern our Paſſions and lower Inclinations, and ſo to keep them from diſturbing us, and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Peace and Tranquility of our Minds. One of the greateſt cauſes of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs to us, and what is moſt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to this Reſt and Tranquility we are ſeeking after, is the Diſorder of our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the Diſturbance and Diſquiet they give us. Anger ruffles us, and puts
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60245:49"/>us into a ſtorm, and deſtroys that ſmooth, calm, and ſedate Temper, that meekneſs puts us in: Envy preys upon it ſelf, and is inwardly corroded with its own ſharp and ſowre humours: Pride ſwells its ſelf with its own inward poyſon, and is blown up with an inward Vapour that Pains and Diſtends it, and makes it very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie, even whilſt 'tis very conceited of its ſelf. Till theſe inward Diſeaſes and Indiſpoſitions and Commotions of Mind are cured in great meaſure, by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions and Directions of Religion, a Man can have no eaſe and quiet in his own Breaſt: for while he is under the power of any of theſe, or indeed of any lower, or bodily Inclination, ſuch as Luſt, Anger, brutal Rage, or brutal Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence; and has not maſtered thoſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Corruptions, nor brought thoſe Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous and Head-ſtrong Paſſions under ſome Government and Subjection to the Laws of Wiſdom and Decency, Vertue and Religion; they will run him into a Thouſand Miſchiefs, Follies, and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, and he will never have true Peace and Tranquility in his own Mind. 'Tis the great buſineſs therefore of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to mortify theſe bodily Paſſions and lower Inclinations, <hi>to Crucify the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts, to put away all Wrath, and Clamour, and Bitterneſs,</hi> and to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60245:50"/>take off the Corruptions and Weakneſſes of Humane Nature, by the rules of Religion, and the aſſiſtances of the Holy Spirit, and to Guard us where ſin doth ſo eaſily beſet us, by the Conſiderations of Heaven and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and another World, which are only Arguments ſtrong enough to make men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and deny thoſe paſſions and Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which are in great part natural to them. Religion has a Power in it, if duly applied and attended to, to make the moſt paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Man Calm and Gentle, the moſt Luſtfull Man Chaſt, to Sweeten the moſt Sowre and ill-natured Temper, and Tame the moſt Outrageous and Violent. This Chriſtianity did of old, as <hi>Lactantius,</hi> and other Fathers aſſure us, and boaſt of its Vertue and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy; and this it no doubt will, and muſt do, in order to our Eternal Happineſs if we come under the full Senſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Government of it: for no Man can go to Heaven with thoſe irregular and unmortified Paſſions about him, any more than come to Peace and Tranquility of Mind here; what is required and is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the one, is neceſſary to the other alſo, and what promotes the one does at the ſame time promote the other; for the more approaches we make towards Heaven hereafter, the more we make at preſent, to this Peace and Tranquillity of Mind; and whatever tends to acquire the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60245:50"/>one, tends alſo to acquire the other: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by the ſame way leads to both, and the more we grow in one, the more we ſhall grow in the other; 'tis one of the greateſt Perfections Religion is to bring us to, not to Deſtroy or Extirpate, but Govern and Maſter our natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and bodily Paſſions, and make them always eaſie to our ſelves, and ſubject to Reaſon, Wiſdom and Vertue; and when they are ſo, then we ſhall be in this moſt Pleaſant and Happy State, which we call Reſt and Tranquility, and Calmneſs of Mind.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Religion, and eſpecially Chriſtianity, removes all Guilt, and all Reaſon of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Trouble of Mind, and Diſquiet of Conſcience; nothing is ſo contrary to this Peace, and Reſt, and Tranquility of Soul as an inward Conſciouſneſs of a Mans own Guilt, and a dread of what he De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves upon it; this will always diſturb and make him uneaſie in whatever out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Condition he be; it will be a Wound at his very Heart, and like a Dart ſtruck thro' his Liver; he will feel it like a Prick upon a Nerve, a Pain in the Tendereſt, and moſt Senſible part of his Mind, for ſuch is a Senſe of Guilt, and the Fears and Horrors that go along with it. Now what ſhall Cure this if a Man has faln into it, and what ſhall beſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60245:51"/>preſerve him from it but Religion? Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity has provided a Remedy for the greateſt Guilt, which is the Blood of Chriſt, and thereby pours in Oyl and Balſam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt wounded Conſcience; and by the Privilege of Repentance and New Obedience reſtores it to Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and a good State, and frees it from its Dreadfull Fears and Apprehenſions; it gives a Man firm Grounds of Hope and Comfort upon his return to his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, tho' he has not always obſerved it, and aſſures him that he ſhall be well treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God upon it. This is a great thing which is owing to the Grace of God, in, and thorough Chriſt; and is the great Grace of the Goſpel, and what natural Religion could not Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Enſure to us: Chriſt alone giveth this Reſt to thoſe who are weary and heavy Laden, with the Burthen of their Sins; and Guilt is a Load and Burthen too heavy for us to bear; but what he has done takes it off from us upon our Repentance and Amendment, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Men, tho' after we have been otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Religion will beſt Guard and Preſerve us againſt all Sin, and keep us from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing raſhly and inconſiderately, that ſhould afterwards trouble and vex us when we reflect upon it; and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60245:51"/>prevent, as well as cure, the painfull Diſorders and Diſturbances of a Guilty Conſcience and Uneaſie Mind, and keep it always in the moſt Virtuous, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt Comfortable ſtate: for nothing is ſuch a ground of Peace and inward Comfort, as to live always in a Habit of Virtue and Religion, in the practice of one, and by the principles of the other, and never to act contrary to them, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them, in any thing we do; this will make a <hi>good Man</hi> always pleaſed and <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied from himſelf as</hi> the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14. and give him the cloſeſt and the trueſt Happineſs, which is the Peace of his own Mind. What a Comfort a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is, it is like Health or Pleaſure, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter felt than deſcribed; 'tis a continual Feaſt in all Conditions, a perpetual ſpring of Joy and Comfort, riſing up in a Mans own Mind, and overflowing his Heart with unſpeakable Pleaſure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: What will make a Man bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Circumſtances? Endure any evil? Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any Affliction? Go through any Croſs or Reproach, and be tho' not without Senſe, yet without any great Trouble? When his Innocent Mind ſpeaks Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to him and Refreſhes him from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60245:52"/>
               <p>A Man can never have true Peace and Tranquility of Mind, without Virtue, and Religion; for none but a good Man conſcious to himſelf of his own Integrity and Sincerity, can have a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: and nothing is ſo contrary to this Eaſe and Reſt, this Tranquility of Soul, as an evil Conſcience, which <hi>like the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Sea,</hi> is always Stormy and Boiſterous, and <hi>caſteth up Mire and Dirt,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20. the filth that is at the bottom of it, and is therefore the moſt directly oppoſite to the Calm and Serene State and Temper of Mind that we are ſeeking after. An evil Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is always full of Fears, and Horrors, of Dread and Diſquietude; 'tis a Worm gnawing on a Mans Vitals, a Vultur prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his Liver, a Snake ſtinging him to the Heart, a Fury Whipping him, a Devil tormenting him, a Hell kindled in his own Breaſt. Nothing can be too great and terrible to repreſent it by, and hardly any thing can come up to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of it, when it is in a high degree. Religion by delivering us from that, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers us from the greateſt trouble and uneaſineſs of Mind; and whoever is not ſtupid and ſenſeleſs, will fall into that ſome time or other, unleſs he live Vertuouſly and Religiouſly.</p>

               <p n="7">7.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60245:53"/>out the ſting of Death, which leſſens and abates its terror, and fortifies us againſt it by the Chriſtian Hopes of being free from all Guilt and Puniſhment hereafter, and of having a better Life, and being in another World, when we are to part with this here.</p>
               <p>Death muſt be very terrible to the thoughts either of an Atheiſt, by Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him of all Being, and of all Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or of a wicked Chriſtian by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning him to Judgment and Puniſhment, and Tranſlating him to Eternal Death and Miſery: only Religion can take off its Terror, and ſweeten the bitter Cup with the Supports, and Comforts, the Aids and Aſſiſtances, the Hopes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations it affords to a good Man in his laſt Agonies and Extremities, and at all other Times when he thinks of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Religion infuſes inward and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Comforts into our Minds from its preſent Privileges and future Hopes, from God and his Spirit, and their ſecret Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, Operations, and Influences upon our Souls, which are the higheſt improvement and the higheſt degrees of Peace and Tranquility of Mind. Nature and Philoſophy knew nothing of this, but Revelation, and eſpecially the Chriſtian, give us the Knowledge and Aſſurance of it,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60245:54"/>and many a Pious and good Chriſtian has felt the Effects and Comforts of it in his Soul, when he has had a Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and well grounded Senſe that his ſins are pardoned in, and through Chriſt, upon his true Repentance; and that he is juſtified by the Grace of the Goſpel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Terms and Conditions of it; and that he has a Title to Heaven by God's promiſe upon his own ſincerity, and has reaſon to Hope that he ſhall partake of all the great and glorious things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Chriſtian Salvation; theſe will raiſe and inſpire him, as it did the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and firſt Chriſtians, with a more than ordinary Comfort, Peace, and Cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs of Soul, and make him very Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, tho' in the greateſt Sufferings and outward Afflictions. 'Twas this which made the Chriſtians Rejoyce always in the Lord, Rejoyce in Tribulations, Sing, and be Cheerfull in Priſons, and be more than Conquerors over all their Troubles, when they had theſe inward Comforts to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and raiſe, and invigorate their Minds: when, tho' their Enemies were implacable and irreconcileable, yet God they knew was reconciled to them, and tho' the World ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thom, yet he loved them; tho' they had Tribulation from without, yet they had Peace in themſelves, and Peace in Chriſt, as he promiſed them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.32.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60245:54"/>and tho' all things were very dark and diſmal about them, yet they had a clear proſpect of Heaven, and, like St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> could ſee that opened thro a ſhower of Stones, and Chriſt ſitting at the right hand of God. One ſuch view of Chriſt and Heaven, tho' but by the Eye of Faith would give a Man a Pleaſure and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of Mind above not only the Pains and Torments he endured, but all other Pleaſures he ever felt in his Life; A great, but ill Man could ſay, That the Pleaſures and Comforts of Religion, even when they are Miſtaken, and Enthuſiaſtick, are great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than all the Pleaſures of Senſe and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality. What are they then when they are true and well grounded? how do they not only give Peace to a Mans Mind, but even Rapture? not only Calm and Quiet it, but Tranſport it? not only give it Reſt and Tranquility, but Extaſie and Joy? This is called in Scripture the <hi>Joy of the Holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>and the Peace of God, which paſſeth all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, Philip.</hi> 4.7. for we do not know how God, who is a Spirit, can Communicate inward Joy and Peace to our Spirits, and convey a ſecret Senſe of his Favour, and Reliſh of his Kindneſs, and make us <hi>taſte, and ſee how Gracious he is,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks <hi>Pſa.</hi> 34.8. and lift up the light of his Countenance upon us. There is more in all
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60245:55"/>this, not only in the extraordinary ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, promiſed in particular Caſes and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, but in the ordinary Hopes and Comforts of Religion to a good Man, than all the Pleaſures of this World, all the Charms and Enjoyments of Fleſh and Blood can ever amount to; and as we plainly feel Peace and Eaſe of Mind to be a greater good than any bodily Pleaſure, and know this from Senſe and Experience, as well as Religion; ſo when this is heighten'd by thoſe unſpeakable Joys, and that inconceiveable Peace, which is derived from God and Religion, and his Holy Spirit; theſe give ſuch an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to this Peace and Tranquility of Mind, as nothing can equal, but the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Heaven; and which the wife Heathens and Philoſophers knew nothing of in their Diſcourſes on this Subject. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Chriſtianity therefore out-doe theſe, and Diſcover new Springs to feed and maintain this, and to raiſe it higher; and tho' they run into the ſame Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, namely, the Happineſs of the Mind, yet 'tis with a fuller Current and a ſtronger Stream: and they do more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly promote that Reſt and Peace and Tranquility of Mind, which tho' it be various in degrees, yet is the greateſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, Perfection or Pleaſure it is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of in general, either in this or the other World.</p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:60245:55"/>
               <p>Whoever attains to this is the Happy Man, whatever his outward Condition be: for while he is eaſie within himſelf, and has an inward Reſt, Peace, and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility in his own Soul, all outward things ſignifie very little to him. Our Saviour did not Promiſe his Diſciples or Followers any good Circumſtances, or Happy outward Condition in this World; but he promiſed them Peace in him, and Peace in themſelves: and that if they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his Example, and learnt his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and lived up to his Religion, they ſhould find Reſt and Eaſe to their Souls, and be freed from thoſe heavy Loads and Burdens that oppreſs our Minds, and are the cauſes of Miſery to us. Religion and Chriſtianity are the true cure for the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, and Indiſpoſitions, and Diſeaſes of the Mind; and if we could live up to its wiſe Rules, and bring our ſelves to that Frame and Temper of Mind it would beget in us, we ſhould be always Eaſy and always Happy; as Happy as we could be in this World, in ſpite of all the evils of it, and Eternally and Compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Happy in the next.</p>

               <p>OUR Saviour did not think fit to give the World a ſet Code of Laws, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did the <hi>Jews,</hi> or a Methodical Syſtem of Ethicks, as other Writers have done ſince; no more did the other wiſe Teachers of Virtue and Morality, <hi>Pythagoras, Socrates, Epictetus, Antoninus,</hi> and other Heathens: the Patriarchs of old, who were Preachers of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60245:57"/>
                  <hi>Solomon</hi> or the Prophets afterwards, but with greater ſimplicity and inartifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial plainneſs, they dropt their excellent Precepts, and ſage Directions without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny formal Method; and thus Chriſt taught us the beſt and moſt perfect Rules of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in his occaſional Diſcourſes, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in this his excellent Sermon upon the Mount, which is ſuch a Diſcourſe that it carries an internal Evidence, and a Heavenly Authority along with it, enough to ſatisfie any Wiſe and Good Man that the Doctrine is true, and that it comes from God, tho' it had no Miracles, nor other Evidence to prove it; for the Soul, if it be not vitiated, Taſtes and Reliſhes ſuch Congenial truths, that are agreeable and natural to it, as the Palate does its food, and Judges of their inward truth and goodneſs, by an internal Senſation and Perception and an immediate Congruity to its Faculties.</p>
               <p>When our Saviour comes towards the Concluſion of this his Sermon upon the Mount, which was an Epitome of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and the Sum of all thoſe Virtuous Precepts which were to make his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers the beſt Men in the World, to make them exceed all the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, and out-doe all the Examples, and all the Characters of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Vertue; he tells 'em there would be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60245:57"/>great Difficulty to riſe to theſe Attainments: that Religion and Vertue in ſuch a pitch as he had ſet them, and as was neceſſary to make a good Chriſtian, and to fit him for Heaven, were not ſuch ſlight and eaſie things; but that they muſt uſe great Care and Pains, and Labour, in the Attaining and Performing of them; that it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eaſie to be vitious and wicked, and therefore moſt Men were ſo: but that to be Virtuous as a Chriſtian ought to be in all thoſe Inſtances and Degrees he had taught them, was a more Hard and Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matter, and that few would come up to it; but yet this was a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to their Eternal Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and they muſt either take the Pains to do this, to come up to theſe ſtrict Terms, or elſe they muſt Periſh and be undone for ever by falling ſhort of them, <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtrait Gate.</hi> From which words I ſhall conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">I. What are the Difficulties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Vertue, or upon what account they are a ſtrait Gate and a narrow Way, and Vice a wide Gate and a broad Way.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Preſs the Duty and propoſe the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for our entering in at this ſtrait Gate and narrow way, notwithſtanding that it is ſo.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:60245:58"/>
               <p n="1">1. What are the Difficulties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Vertue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Then our Saviour's words might perhaps have ſome regard to the hard Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, Dangers, and Perſecutions that Chriſtianity was expoſed to at that time, in thoſe firſt ages of it, and is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to afterwards; then indeed it was a ſtrait Gate, when they who enter'd into it, were bound to leave all they had in this World, all their Temporal Intereſts and Poſſeſſions, for Chriſt's ſake and the Goſpel's, and <hi>all that would live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer Perſecution,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. then it was hard for a Rich Man who had great Poſſeſſions, and was loath to part with them, to follow Chriſt, tho he had a great Deſire and Inclination to do ſo, as in the Inſtance of the young Man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.21. ſo that our Saviour ſaid thereupon, it was eaſier for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel to go thro' the Eye of a Needle, than for a Rich Man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> to become a Chriſtian at that time.</p>
               <p>Then the way to Heaven was ſtrait and narrow, when it was beſet with ſo many Dangers, fill'd with Croſſes and Gibbets, and a Man muſt venture his Life as well as Eſtate, whenever he entered into it; but this was but a particular and accidental caſe, tho
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60245:58"/>every good Chriſtian ought to come to ſuch a Perfection in Religion, as to be prepared and diſpoſed for this, whenever God ſhall think fit to put this hard Tryal and Difficulty upon him. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſtianity is thus ſtrait and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row upon other accounts. <hi>viz.</hi> The ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Terms and Conditions of it, as it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids every ſin and every wilfull wickedneſs upon the Pain of Damnation: This is very hard indeed to the generality of Men, and makes it a very ſtrait and narrow way, when it leaves no room for any one darling Luſt, undue Liberty or beloved Sin to go along with us: for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Goſpel, he that will not part with every willful ſin, however Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant or Profitable it be to him, muſt part with Heaven for it; tho' the Temptation to it be never ſo Great, and the Charms of it never ſo powerfull, yet if Religion do not conquer and overcome it, we muſt for the ſhort Pleaſures of Sin, be Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for ever; tho' it conduces never ſo much to our Intereſt or Advantage, ſo that we could gain the World by it, yet it will prove a dear Bargain at the laſt, and we muſt loſe our Souls for it: for by the irreverſible Terms, and unalterable Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Goſpel every willful and habitual ſin, deſtroys our good State, and without a timely Repentance and Amendment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60245:59"/>us out of Heaven. And however we may think fit to abate of thoſe Terms by our looſe Opinions and falſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and make other Judgments of our ſelves, by the wrong meaſures of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Age, or as Miſtaken and as Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious Doctrines; yet Chriſtianity has ſo plainly fixt theſe, that we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that God will, or can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way abate of them; and to be ſure our Religion does not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There are ſome particular duties in Chriſtianity that ſeem very hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult as well as the general Terms of it; ſuch as loving Enemies, not revenging Injuries, ſelf-denial, Mortification, and the like; which tho' they are againſt the grain of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as ſome Men think, and as impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable as the Rants of Stoical Vertue, yet are made neceſſary to our Pardon and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.43.6.14, 15. <hi>Mark</hi> 8.34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. and they tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are ſo in their right Senſe and Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ought to be as much performed by us, as any other parts of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we are bound as Chriſtians to love our Enemies, with the general Acts of Charity, due to all mankind, not with the particular Offices of kindneſſes due to our Friends; we muſt not revenge an injury to gratify a mere Private and Outrageous Paſſion, without regard to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60245:59"/>good; we muſt deny our ſelves any Worldly Intereſt, when it is Inconſiſtent with our duty; we muſt mortifie every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Paſſion and Senſual Inclination, ſo as to keep it within the bounds of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion: theſe are all agreeable to Reaſon and Prudence, and to the Laws of Civil Government, as well as to the Principles of Religion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Religion puts a check and reſtraint not only upon our Actions, but upon our Words and our very Thoughts, and this is hard, ſome think, that their Tongues ſhould not be their own, nor their Thoughts neither; but that of every idle Word they muſt give an account in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by our Words we ſhall be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned or Juſtified, as well as by our Actions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36, 37. and that our ſecret Thoughts ſhould be tyed up, ſo that we muſt not harbour any wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs even in our Hearts and Thoughts <hi>Mark</hi> 7.21. Now this, however ſevere it ſeems, yet if by idle Words be meant on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil Words, as I doubt not but 'tis, ſuch as thoſe of Slander and Deſamation of which our Saviour there particularly ſpoke; or ſuch Prophane and Lewd Diſcourſe, as tends to affront Heaven, or to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt thoſe who hear it, and proceeds from a Malicious, Irreligious, and Corrupt Mind. This gives ſuch a vicious Tincture, even
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60245:60"/>to our Words, that he who cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter govern his Tongue, than thus to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure his Brother, or let fly at God and Religion, <hi>This Man's Religion is vain,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.26. if he pretend to any: and he who by his Mouth thus vents the Exulcerated Malice, Pride, and Uncharitableneſs of his Heart, and from ſuch an Unchriſtian Temper calls his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fool or Racha, is in danger of Gods Judgment and of Hell-fire, as our Saviour ſays, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. 'Tis the Venom and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of the Heart, and inward Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that, like a Corrupt Fountain, Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Vitiates thoſe ill ſtreams that flow from it; and this is the true Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Principle within us, that Forms and Denominates all our Actions, which are but the Fruits growing upon that Root, and, as our Saviour ſays, <hi>A good Tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth good Fruit, and a Corrupt Tree, that which is evil,</hi> v. 17, 18. of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. All Moral Good and Evil, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and produced from the Heart; and God who ſees it there even before it comes into Act, whenever it has the full conſent of the Will, does very juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Condemn it, and charge it upon us. For, as without this conſent of the Will, no Action is Criminal before him, ſo with it the Crime is both Specified, Committed, and Perfected, tho' it go
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60245:60"/>no further than the Thoughts and the Heart.</p>

Religion requires our lives to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as well as Innocent, and enjoyns us not only to do no ill thing, but to do all the good that we are able; elſe 'tis but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative and a uſeleſs Vertue, the eaſieſt and the ſofteſt ſide of it, like the old Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Privation, without the Matter and Form, that is to give it a Being and a Subſtance. We read in Scripture, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the wicked Servant, who was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of great Crimes, Miſdemeanors, and Injuries againſt his Lord; but of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable one, who did no manner of good, but was idle, and uſeleſs in his Service, and for this Reaſon alone was caſt into outer darkneſs. God will call every one of us to a ſtrict and ſevere account how we have uſed and improved all the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents he committed to us; all the Powers, Abilities and Opportunities of doing good, he hath put into our hands: and if like Loiterers in his Vineyard, we have only Feaſted our ſelves with the Fruits and Delicacies of it, and waſted our idle time in Eaſe and Luxury, and ſpent a vain and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Life in trifling and impertinent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pleaſure or Buſineſs; and not La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured at all in the great Work and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Religion, for which we were ſent into the World: we muſt not at the

               <p n="6">6. Religion requires the Uniform pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of all Vertues, and the entire Union and Conjunction of all Chriſtian Graces to make and conſtitute a good Man; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as any ſingle Vice or willfull Habit of Sin will denominate and make a bad one, ſo as to make him incapable of Happineſs and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Miſery. This is an undoubted truth in Religion, which requires tho' not the Perfection of Degrees, yet the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of parts; ſo that no plain Vertue muſt be wanting, nor no voluntary ſin be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without the certain danger of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded out of Heaven, as St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, he that <hi>ſhall keep the whole Law</hi> beſides, <hi>and yet offend in one point,</hi> willfully break any part of it, Commit one Act of will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Treaſon and Diſobedience againſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>is guilty of all,</hi> reſiſts and oppoſes all that Divine Power and Authority, which gives Force and Sanction to every Law; and becomes liable to the ſame ſort of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho' not to the ſame equal degrees of it.

Theſe are from Religion, its Terms, Conditions and Conſtitutions, there are two other Difficulties ariſing from our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="7">7. A great Reaſon why Religion and Vertue are ſo ſtrait and narrow a way, is becauſe our Natural Appetites and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, which are neceſſary to our preſent ſtate, are ſo many, and ſo hard to be all governed and kept within the bounds of Vertue and Religion; theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from our Animal Nature, and are a true part of us, as Compounded of Fleſh and Blood, and are ſo much Gods Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip and Creation, that we neither
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60245:62"/>can nor ought to deſtroy them; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows us to gratify 'em within due bounds and did not put thoſe ſtrong Appetites in our Natures, meerly to vex and torture and diſatisfie us, but we muſt Govern them with great care, and not lay looſe the Reins upon their Necks, nor let them grow too Maſterleſs and unruly, at any time, for Reaſon and Religion; they are, I confeſs, the great Tryal and Inſtance of Human Vertue, and they may become a ſnare to us, and the great inlets into ſin without due care and watchfullneſs and managery; we muſt be therefore always upon our Guard, leſt this Fleſh and Senſe which we carry about us, and are ſo fond of, become a Traytor to us, and Sin do not ſome way or other ſurprize us, and enter at ſome of thoſe weak places of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; we muſt ſtop and check the ſtrongeſt Inclination when it would lead us into Sin, and ſo far as it is Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, Immoderate, and Exceſſive, deſtroy it, tho' with never ſo much Pains and Violence; we muſt pluck out a right Eye and cut off a right hand, and deſtroy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Sinfull Inclination, be it never ſo Natural to us, and Crucifie the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts, ſo that we may keep them always within the bounds of Wiſdom and Vertue, and ſuffer no <hi>Sin to Reign in our Mortal Bodies, that we ſhould
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60245:62"/>obey it in the Luſts thereof. Romans</hi> 6.12.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Laſtly the Difficulties of Religion, and Vertue ariſe mainly from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and ill Cuſtoms and Habits of Vice which get poſſeſſion of moſt Men before they well Underſtand Religion and the true good and neceſſity of it; our firſt years are a life of Senſe, before we grow up to Reaſon and Underſtanding, and then other things, make the firſt Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon our Minds, and fill them with weak Images and Fancies, and Fooliſh thoughts; and thus when our Paſſions are ſtrong and our Reaſon is weak, Vice gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally gets the ſtart of Religion, and without a very Happy and Virtuous Education, we contract a great many Ill Habits and Vitious Cuſtoms, that increaſe and grow up with us, and 'tis very hard to break and alter thoſe, when we grow Wiſer by Time and Experience, and come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to have a better Senſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and better Apprehenſions about it; tho' we are then convinced of the Folly and Danger of our Sins, yet we are become ſuch Slaves to 'em by long uſe, that it is hard to break their Chains, and get looſe from them, and here lies the great Difficulty of Religion, and this makes it to be a ſtrait Gate, and a narrow way, eſpecially at the firſt entrance into it, when
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60245:63"/>old Cuſtoms and Habits muſt be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and altered, former liberties retrench'd and denied, old Companions muſt be forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and former Temptations muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, and Repentance, which is the hardeſt part of Religion, muſt be the firſt duty of it, and muſt cure the old Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and the long habits of Sin, and in the Scripture phraſe bring in a New Nature, a New Soul, and make us New Creatures and New Men; this is a great Difficulty indeed, but it is brought upon our ſelves by our own fault, and we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame Religion for it any more than we can the Phyſician, or the Phyſick that is to cure us of a Diſeaſe, that we have let run ſo long upon us, that 'tis hard now to perform the cure, and it cannot be done without going thro' a long and tedious courſe, and uſing a ſtrict Regimen, and very great abſtinence from what may be hurtfull to us. The great Argument to perſwade us to all this, is that we muſt die if we do not; if notwithſtanding all theſe Difficulties and hard Things in Religion, we will not comply with it, we muſt be Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for ever, we muſt loſe all that life and happineſs, thoſe Glorious rewards it promiſes to us in another World, and we muſt ſuffer all the Dreadfull, Amazing puniſhments it there threatens.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:60245:63"/>
               <p>There is no reſerve againſt this, but either by perverting Religion, or by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it, either corrupting its Principles, and by falſe and miſtaken Notions gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our ſelves hopes of happineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out living up to the Terms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it, or elſe utterly denying it as a Cheat and a Falſhood, the latter is more impudent and daring, and what but few hardned wretches can come up to, the other is more common, and as Pernicious and Deſtructive. More Souls are loſt by falſe Principles, and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid corrupting of the Doctrines of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, than by downright Atheiſm and Inſidelity, by truſting to a late and Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Repentance, and thinking a little matter will do the buſineſs hereafter, as well as a very ſtrict and a very good life, by relying upon the Mercies of God and the Merits of Chriſt for Salvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Obedience to the Goſpel, and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch things upon which alone thoſe are promiſed, by thinking to be ſaved, or juſtified by Faith alone, without Works or a good Life; and making Faith to lie in a preſumptuous Confidence of Gods Favour, or having an Intereſt in Chriſt, without regard to the plain Terms, and Conditions of Chriſtianity; or by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuperſtitious Doctrines of having ſins pardoned by an Abſolution or an Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60245:64"/>and the like; ſuch Doctrines as theſe, which turn the Grace of God into Wantonneſs, which make Religion an incouragement to Looſeneſs and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, and give Men hopes to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape Miſery, tho' they live in their Sins, and come not up to the ſtrict and ſevere Terms in Religion, but to go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by ſome other Imaginary and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable way, and to be ſaved upon ſome account or other, by Grace, or Chriſt, without entering this ſtrait Gate, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this narrow way; theſe deceive Millions of Souls, who tho they believe Religion, yet do not live up to it, but corrupt and pervert it, ſo as to take off its Force and Influence upon their Lives, and make them never the better by it.</p>
               <p>The other reſerve, which is a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate one, is that of Atheiſm and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, or an utter diſ-believing all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or at leaſt a comfortable Doubt and Suſpicion, that it may not be true, and this I am afraid lies in too many Minds, but then all Mankind have been out of their Wits in believing it, for there have been very few, either in the moſt Wiſe or moſt Barbarous Parts and Ages of the World, but what have done ſo; unleſs then we have been all Cheated with Books of Revelation, and Hiſtories
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60245:64"/>of Miracles done by the Prophets of Old, and by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which are better atteſted than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Actions or any Books beſides, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were in the World 1600 Years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, ſo that we may as well call in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtory, as the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and when we have run into ſuch a Frenzy of Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm as to do that, and without having any poſitive proof againſt Religion, and the Being of God, and another World, for it is impoſſible to have that, and the greateſt Atheiſt will not pretend to have any Evidence, Certainty, and Demonſtration, but that they may be true notwithſtanding all his doubts; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, the whole Frame of Nature and the Wiſe contrivance of the World, of the Heavens above, and the Earth, and Animals below, is a ſtanding E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as great as can be given of the truth of Religion in general; and a Man's Reaſon muſt be wretchedly blinded with his Vices, who doth not ſee it, or who winks ſo hard that he will not diſcern it; theſe wretched Reſerves being therefore taken away, I ſhall proceed to preſs the duty of entering in at the ſtrait Gate, and narrow way, and propoſe the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to engage us to this, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Difficulties I mentioned.</p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:60245:65"/>
               <p n="1">1. Religion is a buſineſs of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that whatever ſtraits and hardſhips there be in it, we muſt not ſtick at thoſe, but reſolve however to go through with it, for our Life, our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, our All, our Eternal ſtate lies at ſtake, and depends upon it; Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our only tells us <hi>ſtrait is the Gate, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is the way which leadeth unto Life, and wide is the Gate, and broad is the way which leadeth to Deſtruction:</hi> And this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, if Life and Death be ſet before us; whatever be the way to them, we ſhould look at the great Ends, Iſſues, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of things, which are the mark a Wiſe Man always aims at, and whatever means are in our Power, to attain the one and avoid the other, we ſhould make uſe of, without any long Counſel or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation; for no Man demurrs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders whether he ſhall chooſe happineſs and eſcape Miſery, Nature, and Inſtinct prevent our Reaſon here, and we are made with an inward ſpring which runs of it ſelf to the one, and flies from the other, whenever we truly apprehend them; and therefore did we conſider what that Life is, that Eternal Life of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which Vertue leads to, which is to live in the perfect Enjoyment of the greateſt good, and the pureſt Pleaſures free from all Alloys and all Approach of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60245:65"/>the leaſt Evil and Trouble, to live for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver with God and Angels in rapturous Bliſs, and Heavenly Delights, and Joy unſpeakable, to be Poſſeſt of a Crown, a Kingdom of ſubſtantial Glory, and all ſuch Good and Deſirable things, that this World affords but a faint Shadow, and imperfect Reſemblance of; we ſhould find this is a Life worth being fond of, and ſeeking after, compared to which, this our preſent ſhort life mixt with ſo much real Care and Trouble, and ſo little imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pleaſure, is but a ſort of Death, but walking in a vain Shadow, and Dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Happineſs, and hardly worth a Wiſe Man's chooſing, were it not for a better Life, which is only worth the name of Living, where we are born into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, and Vertue ſhall give us a Glorious Immortality; this is a Reward that will ſufficiently Recompenſe our ſhort Labours here, and were Religion never ſo Difficult, yet the worth, and greatneſs of that, were our Hopes and Deſires of it proportionable to it, would inſpire us with new Vigour and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and convey Strength and Power enough to carry us through them all; for what will not a great reward make Men do, whither will they not Travel, where will they not fight, what danger will they Flinch from, what Labour will they Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60245:66"/>when a certain and great reward is offered to 'em? And had we but as good thoughts of Heaven, as the Soldier has of Honour and Victory, the Merchant of Gold and Gain, and the Husbandman of a good Harveſt, we ſhould never think much of all the Pains and Difficulties that are in Religion, were they a great many more than they are; as on the other ſide, if Men had but a due ſenſe of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to which the wide Gate and the broad way of wickedneſs leads 'em, and the Sad and Dreadfull Condition their Vices will bring 'em to in another World, did they conſider what exquiſite and amazing Miſery, both of Soul and Body, is wrapt up in thoſe Words of Hell and Damnation, no Vice, tho' ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo Charming, would make 'em en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it for one day, no Pleaſure of Sin for a Seaſon, would make 'em bear it for ſo long a time as this Life is, and nothing would ever tempt 'em, not only not to ſuffer it for ever, but to run the hazard and venture of it, were there not a thouſand times the reaſon to fear it that we have by Religion, and were it but meerly probable, or but juſt poſſible, which Atheiſm it ſelf can never deny, yet no Wiſe man would expoſe himſelf to ſuch a Dreadfull and Irretrieva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble danger for the Poor and Pitifull Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that are in the greateſt Sin.

               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:60245:66"/>
               <p n="2">2. Beſides the Conſideration of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, Religion with all its ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hardſhip, does not abridge us of any Comfortable Enjoyments of this World, nor Deprive us of any of the true Pleaſures and good things here, which a Wiſe Man would Deſire, or which our Nature was made for; for they may be all enjoyed within the compaſs of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and allowances of Religion, and that with more Convenience and Advantage than in a Courſe of Vice and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; Religion does not Deprive us of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good proper to our State and Nature, nor tye us up from any of the Comforts or Pleaſures of Life, with a peeviſh ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and moroſeneſs, with a touch not, taſt not, handle not, but only reſtrains us from what would be Evil, and Pernicious to us, if it were allowed us; keeps us from the forbidden Fruit, and from thoſe exceſſes and extravagancies, that are Deſtructive to our ſelves and Miſchievous to the World; it does not deſtroy any of our Natural Pleaſures, but refines and purifies them, and draws them off from the filth, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments which lies always at the bottom of thoſe that are ſinfull, and ſo it makes them clearer and ſweeter, and frees them from all that Nauſeouſneſs and Bitterneſs that Vice generally mixes with them; Virtue does neither Decay nor Diſeaſe our
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60245:67"/>Bodies, Trouble, or Torment our Minds, Conſume or Squander away our Eſtates, nor Ruin and Shipwrack our Fortunes, nor bring any ſuch Miſchiefs upon us in this World, as Mens Sins often do, but as keeping the bounds of it, will lead us to Eternal Life, ſo it will generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and improve the greateſt happineſs we are capable of in this.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Religion is as eaſie as God could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly make it, and none of its Straitneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Severities are Arbitrarily impoſed upon us, but from the Reaſon and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of things, and the abſolute Fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Goodneſs and Wiſdom of whatever it Commands, and its real Tendency to our greateſt Perfection and Happineſs; for Religion is not an Arbitrary and Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thing, made ſo by the mere Will and Pleaſure of God, which might have leſſened our Burthen and abated of our Duty in many Caſes had he pleaſed, and not impoſed ſuch hard Tasks, and ſuch ſtrait and ſevere Vertues upon us, but have left us more looſe and not tyed us up ſo ſtrictly as he has done; this is a great Miſtake, and a wretched Miſ-un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of Religion, for that as to the moral part of it, is founded in the Nature and Perfections of God, which are Eternal and Unalterable, and in the as Eternal and Unalterable Reaſons of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60245:67"/>things, and thoſe Reſpects and Relations which they neceſſarily have to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo that as God cannot alter the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Circle or a Triangle, nor make two and two not to be four, ſo neither can he the Nature of Vice and Vertue, nor make Good to be Evil, or Evil Good. Moral Vertues are as much founded in the Nature of things, as Mathematical Truths, or Metaphyſical Verities, and the Properties of them are as certain, and fixt as thoſe of Lines or Numbers. Such Actions are as neceſſary to the good of the World, and the Happineſs of Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and particular Perſons, as ſuch Offices and Operations of the Body, are to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain its Life and Health, ſo that breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not more neceſſary to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the one, than Juſtice, Fidelity, and other Vertues are to the other; and ſhould God have let us looſe from any of thoſe Virtues, even the ſtricteſt of them, which the Libertines are moſt apt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain againſt, ſuch as thoſe which reſtrain their Natural Paſſions of Luſt and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, he would have let in a Thouſand Miſchiefs and Evils into the World, and have roade us, as Brutiſh and Uncivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and as miſerable as the very Beaſts themſelves, and as uncapable of Society, and the benefits of good Order and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment.

               <p n="4">4. As all the Laws of God are good and as eaſie as he could make them, ſo they are made more eaſie by that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, and Aſſiſtance, whereby he enables us to perform them, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Difficulties of Religion are much lightened and abated; for every thing is ſaid to be light, or heavy in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſtrength and power of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and according as our ſtrength is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by the Divine Grace and Holy Spirit, ſo is Religion and Vertue, made more eaſie to us; ſo much then of inward ſtrength and power as is conveyed to our Minds by Gods Grace, which is a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical and Secret Energy like that of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward life, <hi>Strengthening us mightily, in the inward Man, regenerating, quickning, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, raiſing, enlivening us,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks, ſo much lighter is the Burden of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that God lays upon us; for it is the ſame thing to take off ſo much from that or to add ſo much new ſtrength to him that is to bear it; and therefore however hard and difficult Religion be to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and imperfection of Human Nature, to our ſingle power, which would of it ſelf fall and ſink under it, yet when we have the Aſſiſtance of Heaven, and the Aids and Supplies of Gods Grace to help and cooperate with us, then we can do all things through Chriſt which ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60245:68"/>us, and thro' his Grace, which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for us; and we cannot in reaſon complain for want of Power when we may have it, and God is ready to give us whatever power we want, even to Conquer the ſtrongeſt Propenſities, and moſt irreſiſtable Temptations; and this will take greatly off from the badneſs of the way which leads to Life, when we have the Spirit of God like a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel to lead us thro' it, always to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and Help, and Incourage us in it, ſo that it would be much more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tho' it were thro' never ſo Dark and Unpleaſant a Wilderneſs, when, like the <hi>Jews,</hi> we have the preſence of God and his power to Conduct us all along to the Happy Land.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Tho' we are apt to complain of the Difficulties in Religion, yet there is no great End whatever which we can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain without as much Pains and Labour, and going thro' as many Difficulties and Hardſhips as we do in Religion; No Man can arrive to Learning or to any Liberal Art or Science in any Perfection; no Man can riſe to Honour and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, can get an Eſtate, or the like, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out uſing as much Diligence, as much Care and Watchfullneſs, as in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Religion, without denying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as many Liberties, ſpending as much
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60245:69"/>Time and keeping himſelf to as ſtrict Rules and Meaſures, as are in Religion: Nay, I dare ſay, many a Man takes more Pains and meets with more Difficulties to get a ſorry livelihood in this World, than would ordinarily carry a Man to Heaven, and make him live Happily for ever; what ſhall we then charge God ſo Fooliſhly, as if he had uſed us hardly in Religion, and make the way to Happineſs ſtrait and narrow and difficult, when we as ordinarily and more willingly, take as much Pains and go through as many Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties in all other things; 'tis becauſe we have not ſuch a value and Eſteem of the Ends and Deſigns of Religion, as we have of other Worldly ones, that we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the Hardneſs and Difficulty of that above the other; did we think Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as Deſirable as an Eſtate, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as great a Good as Honour, which is but the ſhadow of it, we ſhould purſue it as vigorouſly and overlook and contemn all the Difficulties that lie in the way to it, and there is this advantage in ſeeking and purſuing the Ends and Deſigns of Religion above any of thoſe in this World, not only as they are far greater, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more valuable and important, but that the one is certainly to be attained, if we uſe our utmoſt Care and Diligence, whereas we may ſail and be Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Many Sinners take more pains and trouble, and run thro' more difficulties to compaſs their vitious Deſigns, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their Sins, than a good Man does in gaining Heaven, and practicing the hardeſt Vertues and Duties of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For thus, how reſtleſs and unwearied, and indefatigable are the Covetous and Ambitious, the Revengeful and Maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, or the Luſtful and Debaucht, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Ends, and gratifie their extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Deſires and Inclinations: How do their ſeveral Luſts put them upon the hardeſt Drudgery, and make them Toil and Labour, Watch and Attend, Project and Contrive, and be at more pains and trouble to undo themſelves for ever, than would ſave their Souls, and make 'em Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for ever. The Devil is much the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Maſter of the two, and puts his Slaves to more vile and uneaſie work in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude of Sin, than God does his Children and Servants in the doing the hardeſt part of their Duty, and many have been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Martyrs in the Devil's Service, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60245:70"/>gone through more for the ſake of their Luſts than other Martyrs have done for heir Religion, and for the ſake of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Tho' Vice ſeems more Natural, as fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in with ſome Propenſities and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations that are within us, yet how muſt a man at firſt, offer great Violence to himſelf, and to the tender ſenſe of his own Mind, before he can be brought to commit a great Sin? With what Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy and Self-denial, as great as any that Vertue puts upon us, does he part with his firſt Innocence, and enter upon a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, till by degrees he grows a leſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and more Couragious Sinner, and is led on at laſt to commit it with greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and it becomes Natural to him, and 'twould be no great difficulty for him to leave it, but 'tis only the Cuſtom and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit makes it ſo, and not any thing in Nature, or in the thing it ſelf? For let the Cuſtoms be equal on both ſides, and let a Man be as long uſed to Vertue as he was to Vice, and he ſhall find that as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and agreeable and as hard to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome as the other, ſo that as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture repreſents it, it is as hard for him that has been accuſtomed to do evil, to learn to do good, as for the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> to change his Skin, or the Leopard his Spots, <hi>'Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>So whoſoever is born of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60245:70"/>God,</hi> i. e. a very good Man, <hi>doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin, and he cannot ſin becauſe he is born of God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. But</p>
               <p>Laſtly, and to conclude, it ought to be no manner of Prejudice to Vertue, that there are but a few that enter the ſtrait Gate, and find the way to Life, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that go in at the wide Gate and the broad way, that leadeth to Deſtruction, as our Saviour ſays. This ought not to be regarded by us as a Diſcouragement to Vertue, or as any good reaſon to be wicked for Company, tho I doubt it is a very common and prevailing one, and draws a great many into the broad way, becauſe they ſee ſuch great Numbers in it, and they do not care to be ſingular nor to be Reproached for being ſo, but are willing to do what they ſee ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others do, and hope to eſcape as well as the reſt, and that they run but the ſame riſque and hazard, that they ſee ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Thouſands do beſides, and ſo they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to venture as well as others, let the Preachers ſay what they pleaſe; Now this, however common and powerfull it be, yet is the moſt unreaſonable thing in the World; for is any man in another caſe willing to be ſick or to die for Company, or for the ſake of example? Would any be ſo Eaſie or ſo Complaiſant, as to pledge another in a Cup of Poyſon, or would
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60245:71"/>he not ſtop the mad frolick when he ſaw the reſt of the Company drop down Dead before him? Is any Man unwilling to avoid the Plague if he can, becauſe there is ageneral Infection, and becauſe ſo many of his Neighbours or Acquaintance have died of it? Would any refuſe the ſaving his life, and eſcaping, if he could, upon a Plank, becauſe the reſt of his Company are Sinking and Drowning? Did Men think it as much worth their while to ſave their Souls as their Lives, how many ſoever loſt them, had they as Juſt and terrible Apprehenſions of their own Damnation, as they have of their Dying the Temptation of Example and Company would be quickly taken off, and ſignifie nothing? For alas; what Comfort will it be in the Flames of Hell to hear ſo many others Roaring and Howling in them, their hideous Cries and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Lamentations will rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, than leſſen them, and make it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a more ſad and diſmal Scene of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, like that of a whole City or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſwallowed up by an Earthquake or overflowed with the Eruptions of a burning Mountain, and the liquid ſtreams of Fire and Brimſtone: No Man who knows what it is to be Happy but would wiſh to be ſo tho he were alone, and no Man who knows that vertue alone is the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60245:71"/>way to life and happineſs, but muſt chuſe to be Vertuous, tho' he ſaw never ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wicked, let them Reproach and Laugh at him as long as they pleaſe for a Man ſingular and by himſelf, let them count his Life Folly, for being ſo ſtrict and preciſe (if it be in the great matters of Vertue) for not drinking to the utmoſt pitch, nor daring to ſwear the leaſt Oath, nor venturing upon a Debauch, or any Common, or any Modiſh, or Faſhionable Vice (the Reproach and Scandal of which is took off by the great Party and Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it has of its ſide) but living up ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Rules of the Goſpel, and the Terms of Salvation there laid down with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch abatements, as the looſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, or looſe Practices of others, are willing to put upon them (ſince God will not alter his Methods or Judgments by any of thoſe) let them I ſay Condemn on Deride him never ſo much for this, and call him Preciſe Fool, or Formal Saint, and the like, yet no Man that knows the good of Vertue, will be Laughed out of it by a Nick-name, or be aſham'd of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſingular in that any more than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Excellency of Learning, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or Wiſdom above others; and I ſuppoſe none of thoſe who are ſo much againſt ſingularity but would be willing to be Rich, or to be Well, and at Eaſe,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:60245:72"/>though never ſo many others were Poor, or Sick, and in Pain, and why then not to be Vertuous and Happy, tho' never ſo many others are Vitious and Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

               <p>THis moſt Excellent Sermon of our Bleſſed Saviour, as in every thing it gives us the higheſt and the nobleſt precepts of Vertue, that are above all the Morals of the wiſeſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and far excell the beſt rules of the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60245:73"/>greateſt Maſters in Philoſophy, which might have convinced <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> it ſelf, that he muſt be, if not, the Son of God, yet ſome great and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perſon ſent from above, that without Travel abroad or Education at home, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in a poor Trade, ſhould outdo even <hi>Socrates,</hi> or the more admired Moraliſts amongſt 'em, ſo he has all along adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 'em to Humane Nature, and our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State and Circumſtances in this World, which was a thing that they were defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in; for as they often were too ſhort in their precepts and much below the things, ſo at other times they were as much too high and gave precepts that were too big, and not at all fitted to the ſize and ſcantling of our preſent State or the make of Humane Nature; they were not only for wiſely Moderating and Governing, but quite rooting all Paſſions and Affections whatever out of their wiſe man, which was to make him not a Man, or ſuch a Creature, with ſuch Faculties and Powers, as God thought for wiſe reaſons fit to do, this was not to improve but deſtroy Human Nature and to ſet Vertue beyond its pitch and out of its reach, which our Saviour who knew our Frame and our outmoſt Capacities has never done; they went ſo far in their rants about the contempt of this World
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60245:73"/>and deſpiſing riches as to commend him that fooliſhly threw them into the Sea, that they might be no hindrance to his deeper Philoſophizing. Now this as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed a great weakneſs in him that could not otherwiſe better uſe 'em, ſo 'tis Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating Virtue, not for this World, but for ſome other <hi>Eutopian Meridian,</hi> the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it not Uſeful and Comfortable, but Deſtructive of our preſent State and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in this World; and tho our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour both by his Life, and his precepts, ſhowed as great contempt of the things of this World, as ever any perſon did, and has given the beſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that can be, not to be ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous for outward things, nor take any thought for the Morrow, in the latter part of this Chapter, by truſting in the Divine Providence, and being eſpecially carefull about better things, the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs, yet he has no where told us that theſe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, and that a Man muſt throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Eſtate, and renounce all his worldly goods, as well as the Pomps and Vanities of this World, if he will become a Chriſtian and go to Heaven; this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ſaid to be the Hereſie of <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> in which he was not likely to have very many Followers; and tho ſeveral places of Scripture tell us <hi>how hardly
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60245:74"/>they that have Riches ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Mark</hi> 10.23. and that <hi>it is eaſier for a Camel to go through the Eye of a Needle, than for a Rich Man is enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> v. 25. which is all meant of <hi>them that truſt in Riches,</hi> v. 24. that we cannot ſerve God and Mammon, bids us <hi>not love the World nor the things that are in the World, for if any Man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 John 2.15. yet they all import no more, and ſo will be fairly underſtood, by this excellent directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviour that I am now to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of, <hi>Lay not up for your ſelves Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither is that purely a Negative, an Univerſal forbidding us to lay up any Treaſures upon Earth, for if we do not that in ſome meaſure, we are not guilty only of great Imprudence, but even of Infidelity too, <hi>If any provide not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own Houſe, he hath denied the Faith, and is worſe than an Inſidel,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. not to make proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ones own Off-ſpring and Children is to be more Unnatural than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, nay, than the very Fowls, and the moſt Ravenous Beaſts, and not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply an Aged Helpleſs Parent, is to be guilty of that which the Heathens coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the moſt infamous Ingratitude; nay, if
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60245:74"/>by an honeſt Induſtry and lawful Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we do not ſome way or other, make our ſelves ſerviceable to the publick and able to procure ſome good, to the whole of which we are parts, we are like dead and uſeleſs Members, that ſerve neither for Life nor Motion, nor the conveyance of Blood and Spirits; and as in the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body, ſo alſo in the civil, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to maintain either its Life or Strength, unleſs ſome greater parts are Repleniſhed with a larger abundance of Blood and Spirits, and there be a general. Circulation and leſſer conveyance of 'em to every part. Neither Government nor the World could ſubſiſt ſo long as God intends it, if Men ſhould lay aſide all pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent care about the things of this World; all would be put into a dead Hand, and that would quickly make a dead Body, if it were not Lawfull for ſome Men to Trade and grow Rich; the preſent ſtate of this World makes this to be neceſſary and is utterly inconſiſtent with general Vows of Poverty, and as a Man may Lawfully work for his livelihood, (and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtles Rule, <hi>He that will not work neither ſhould he eat,</hi> 2.

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60245:75"/>and not Sacrifice,</hi> nay, more expreſly, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7.22. <hi>I ſpake not unto your Fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>concerning burnt-Offerings or Sacrifices, but this thing commanded I them, ſaying, Obey my voice, i. e.</hi> this was what in the firſt and chief place I commanded you, and very much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred and Regarded before the other, ſo <hi>Joel</hi> 2.13. <hi>Rent your Hearts and not your Garments, i. e.</hi> have an inward Sorrow and Humiliation, rather than an outward; and a great many other Phraſes, that ſeem expreſly to forbid a thing, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to ſomething elſe that may ſtand in Competition with it, when yet they do not ſo abſolutely, but only diminiſh and leſſen it, in reſpect of the other and prefer that before it, and ſo this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept as it lies in my Text, whole and entire, without breaking it into parts, is plainly to be underſtood and includes in it theſe ſeveral things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we ſhould much more Value and Eſteem Heavenly Treaſures in our Thoughts and Affections, than Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That whenever there is a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition between thoſe, and we cannot ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure both, we part with the Earthly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Heavenly.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:60245:76"/>
               <p n="3">3. That we uſe as much Care and Diligence to obtain the Heavenly as the Earthly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That we ſo ſeek the Earthly as to make 'em Means and Inſtruments to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtaining the Heavenly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we ſhould ſet a greater value upon Heavenly Treaſures in our Thoughts and Affections than upon Earthly, that we ſhould account them much more er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and deſirable things and place our Happineſs and chief good in thoſe, but not in the other; We may allow theſe outward things ſuch a due place in out Thoughts as they deſerve, that they are Comfortable Conveniencies, and Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Accommodations to our preſent ſtate, but not ſuch things as are good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or that can afford us any true Happineſs, but what we ſee Men as Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable in their fulleſt Enjoyment of, as thoſe who have the greateſt want of 'em, by no means comparable to Wiſdom or to Goodneſs and Vertue, or the leaſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Underſtanding and Mind; ſuch as is in ſome meaſure proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the wants of Nature and the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this Life, a wiſe Man may count deſirable, who is not bound with a Stoical fullenneſs to think it indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent whether he be Clothed or Naked whether he Starve or have Food to eat,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60245:76"/>nor in a Cynical Bravado throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Earthen Diſh becauſe he can drink without it, and deſpiſe every thing but his Tub and Sun-ſhine; no this is a ſelf-denying kind of Haughtineſs, that deſpiſes every thing becauſe it over-values it ſelf, and contemus not only the World, but the maker of it too, who would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have placed us in ſuch a well Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Habitation, if we might not have uſed the Conveniencies that belong to it, nor have been at all the better for all the rich ſtores he has laid in for the uſe of his Creatures; but then indeed we are to account them but as common Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſills, that are convenient for our lower and ſmaller occaſions, not as our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and what we account of any great Worth or Value, or make to be a prime ingredient into our true Happineſs; tho' they may ſeem to give ſome outward Colour and Varniſh, yet that muſt be ſomething within, and if it be not ſound underneath, 'twill quickly moulder away and conſume for all they can do, that are no more to be thought parts of our Happineſs, than our Hair or Nails are parts of a Man, ſuch Excrementitious parts as may outwardly adorn, but be no manner of cauſe of the true Life, or ſtrength of the Body, ſuch Goods as we may value and deſire and purchaſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60245:77"/>too according to that low and moderate rate, which they bear in proportion to the real needs of this preſent Condition; out to over-prize and eſteem them as things equal to Vertue and Goodneſs or to place our <hi>ſummum bonum,</hi> or chief Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in 'em, and let 'em take up the chiefeſt place in our Hearts and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this is to worſhip Mammon, to ſet up that for an object of my ſtrongeſt Paſſion and Devotion, which ought to have the loweſt place in 'em.</p>
               <p>Thus to <hi>ſet our Hearts upon Riches, if they do encreaſe,</hi> which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 62.10. to truſt in 'em, as our Saviour ſpeaks, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.24. and place our greateſt confidence in thoſe, as if we might ſurely expect Happineſs from 'em; this is the Idolatry the Apoſtle Charges Covetouſneſs with, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. ſetting up a Golden Calf, to help us in our Diſtreſs inſtead of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and making a Deity of that which would do very well in ear-rings and Bracelets; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that which would be ſerviceable in the matters of this Life, to be ſo high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly valued and even adored by us, is like the Folly of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> who bowed down and Worſhipped that wooden Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Hercules,</hi> which <hi>Diagoras</hi> made a good Fire of, that helpt to dreſs his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, that being a much better uſe of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60245:77"/>Wood, than to be made a God of. And he that has a due ſenſe of the meanneſs, the Uncertainty and Tranſitorineſs of theſe Earthly Treaſures in reſpect of the Heavenly, their being ſubject to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Ruſt, to be eaten by Moths, Secretly Waſted and Devoured, or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently ſeiz'd upon by Thieves, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a thouſand Caſualties, will not be ſo apt to over-value them or prefer 'em to the other; if we compare and bring 'em together, we ſhall find a very great difference between 'em upon many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Theſe Earthly Treaſures are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a great many Hazards and Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, which the others are not, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Rapine may force 'em out of our hands, tho' we hold 'em never ſo faſt, fraud may ſecretly beguile us of 'em, before we are aware, or a Pyrate may Rob and a Storm ſink all our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in an Inſtant, and if they come ſafe home, yet they may be loſt there, a War may Plunder us of all we have, or a Fire may make a ſpeedier Deſtruction, and Devour in a moment the fulleſt Barns, or the richeſt Ware-houſes, and we may ſit like <hi>Job</hi> mourning upon their Allies, the only thing it has left us; ſo many various Caſualties are they ſubject to, ſo little are we inſured of them, that we
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60245:78"/>hold 'em at the Mercy and Favour of a thouſand Contingencies; but the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Treaſures are quite out of harms way, and not ſubject to the Chance or Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie of Fortune; no Man can ſteal away our Virtue without our own conſent; it's ſafe in our own Breaſt, and lock'd up ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Minds; the Oppreſſor that can ſtrip us Naked of every thing elſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not touch our Innocence, nor take that from us. The <hi>Sabaeans</hi> could rob <hi>Job</hi> of his Oxen and his Aſſes; a Fire could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume his Cattle, and the fall of a Houſe bury all his Children in the ſame Grave, but nothing could remove his Patience and take away his Integrity, that ſtill he retained and held faſt, <hi>Job</hi> 2.3, 9. The Philoſopher that loſt all in a wreck, yet kept his Philoſophy and Wiſdom in ſpite of Fortune, and the Apoſtles, who left all they had, ſtill preſerved their Religion and a good Conſcience, which by the decree of the Senate could not be Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſter'd, nor Confiſcate by the Emperor's Edicts; thoſe inward Treaſures of the Mind are ſafe, when things without are never ſo uncertain, and when they ſhall bring us to another World, then they ſecure beyond poſſibility of the leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; whatever Storms and Shelves and Rocks we paſs thro' here, when we once Land and ſet Foot upon the ſhore of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60245:78"/>we are out of all danger and in a ſafe harbour, where we ſhall enjoy the rewards of all our Toil, and be vaſtly enriched with Treaſures of that Happy and Secure place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe Earthly Treaſures are fading and Tranſitory, but the Heavenly are durable and laſting; <hi>Riches certainly make themſelves Wings and ſly away as an Eagle to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Heaven, Prov.</hi> 23.5. of a ſudden we know not how they are got out of ſight, and we can never ſet Eyes on 'em again; they leave their poſſeſſor ſometimes without much warning; like Tides, they rowl from one Shore to another, from this Man or Family to the other, and leave him perhaps a Beggar to day, who was in the greateſt Plenty but a little before, or if they be not ſo Fickle nor leave the owner on a ſudden, yet in a little time he muſt leave them, Death will ſtrip him naked as he came into the World, <hi>and then all his thoughts periſh, Pſ.</hi> 146.4. All his thoughts of being rich or great, or happy in this World, all the mighty Projects and deep Contrivances about worldly things are quite at an end, and a ſudden ſtop is given to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of bigger Barns or finer Houſes, or making greater purchaſes and laying up more of theſe Earthly Treaſures. The Soul is perhaps taken from him the night
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60245:79"/>before he was reſolved to do all this, and then how inſignificant are they all, and what is he the better for 'em. Thus Fooliſh it is to carry on only ſuch ſhort deſigns, that we muſt break off very ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and abruptly, and not lay our Thoughts deeper than the Grave, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this tranſitory Life, not to have our thoughts and aims upon greater things that muſt for ever imploy our Minds, that are more laſting and durable, of a more ſixt and ſolid Nature, and that will laſt as long as our immortal Souls, that we may ſit down with, and bid our Souls be for ever at reſt, for they have goods laid up, not only for many years, but for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Theſe Earthly Treaſures are ſuch empty things, that they can never give us ſuch inward Happineſs, as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly will: We are apt indeed to admite at the brave outſide, the appearing gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and finery of the Rich and Great, but all this without Vertue, is but ſhow and pageantry; they have none of that real Happineſs, nor enjoy any thing of that fatisfaction we imagine they do; they have a thouſand Troubles and Multitudes of cares, cauſed even by their Riches and Greatneſs, that lie heavy upon 'em; vaſt loads of unſeen miſeries oppreſs 'em, and inward and ſecret guilt fills 'em with
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60245:79"/>horror; and vaſt legions of evil Spirits haunt and diſturb thoſe Houſes within, that look ſo ſtately and beautifully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. We make very falſe meaſures, and are mightily miſtaken if we conclude him to be Happy, that we ſee has the viſits and the Complements, and the greateſt Court made to him, alas, we ſee not into his Mind nor how uneaſie he is there, and how little the better for our fooliſh O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of him; 'tis only his own thought; and his own vertue and good temper of Mind that make him a Happy Man for all this, and without this he may Cheat others, but he can never deceive him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; theſe are inward and cloſe to his Mind, and indiſcernible to any one but himſelf, the other are all external and looſe, like Scenes and Pictures looking fine at a diſtance, but if we come near 'em, 'tis all groſs daubing, they cannot yield us that Enjoyment and Happineſs that we vainly fancy and expect in 'em; and whilſt we imagine we embrace what we can wiſh, it proves but a thin Cloud and Air, and very often what the wiſe Man found it, who had made as many Experiments about worldly Happineſs as any Man did, <hi>Vanity and Vexation of Spt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> and therefore not worth ſo much paſſion and concern to attain 'em, nor fit that we ſhould <hi>lay out our Money for that which is not
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60245:80"/>Bread, and our labour for that which ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieth not, Iſai.</hi> 55.2. for windy and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty traſh, rather than for that ſolid food, which will nouriſh and feed and feaſt 'em to all Eternity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whenever there is a Competition between thoſe, and we cannot ſecure both, that we part with the Earthly rather than the Heavenly; when we do an ill thing in order to our worldly intereſt, when a Bargain will not go off unleſs it be voucht with a downright lye, nor an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate be got without open Knavery, or ſome underhand ſlight and ſecret inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, nor a great Place or Preferment be obtained unleſs we venture upon ſome thing that is mean, and ſhamefull, and diſhoneſt, then to ſcorn to do a baſe thing for any advantage, and to prefer Honeſty and Conſcience, before Gain or Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, this is to value the Heavenly more than the Earthly Treaſures; this ſhows we love Vertue, for it ſelf, when we chooſe that alone, not for its preſent dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or portion, but for its own ſake, and what we may expect hereafter, and will not forſake it for all the offers that the World can make: This indeed, is the true gage of our Affections, the true way to meaſure our love to theſe worldly things, and know whether it be too great and immoderate or no; if we will be guilty
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60245:80"/>of the leaſt Sin or Injuſtice, in order to the getting Money or growing Rich, if we will wrong the Orphan or cheat the Widow, whoſe Eſtate is entruſted to us, if we will break our promiſe and deny our word, when it would be ſome loſs to us to perform it, and avoid a Juſt debt upon ſome little trick or legal nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or do any thing for our Intereſt that comports not with fair dealing, with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and an honeſt mind; why, this ſhews that we have too great a love and value for theſe Earthly things, when we are taken ſo with the tempting Charms of 'em, that if we cannot fairly court 'em to our Embraces, we will commit a Rape upon 'em and force 'em ſome way or other into our poſſeſſion. When <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both</hi>'s Vineyard looks ſo pleaſant and beautifull that <hi>Ahab</hi> will purchaſe it, tho' at the hard rate of Perjury and falſe-Witneſs; when we had rather part with our Vertue, and violate our Conſcience, than let go a preſent intereſt, ſo that when theſe two are put together in the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of our cooler Judgment, Earthly Treaſures do much outweigh the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly in our Thoughts, and though they are much lighter in themſelves, yet our affections always caſt the Scales on that ſide; and ſo likewiſe in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as well as getting of Riches, when
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60245:81"/>we uſe 'em baſely or not at all, and be unwilling to part with 'em upon a good occaſion, when a decent opportunity calls for 'em, when our poor Brother ſtands in need of 'em, when God or the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick require 'em of us, when we can ſerve the ends of Piety or Charity, or publick good by 'em, then not to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with 'em, this is a certain ſign that we love 'em too well, that we think nothing ſo good as our Money, and that we count it much more eligible to be Rich, than to be either Good, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, or Pious, and that we had much rather be one than the other; nay, which is ſtrange, be one than both, ſo little do we value every thing elſe, and think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be compared to a great heap, and a long inventory, and that what we have in our Cheſts and our Coffers is much more valuable than what we have in our Souls, or than the Soul it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This comparative precept ſuppoſes that we muſt uſe as much care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to obtain the Heavenly as the Earthly Treaſures, and if Men would once do that, I am ſure they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver miſs of the former; if we would as heartily and diligently ſet about getting Heaven, and making our ſelves Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as we do about getting a livelihood, and making our ſelves Rich, we ſhould
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:60245:81"/>never ſail of the one, tho' we very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do of the other; a thouſand Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and Contingences hinder us of obtaining our worldly aims, and with all our thoughts and toil, and care, we can never compaſs our wiſhes, but when we have tir'd our ſelves with a hot and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger purſuit of theſe worldly things, and followed 'em as cloſe as we could thro' a hundred mazes and labyrinths, yet they fly away, and we can never catch or lay hold of them; But in the Heavenly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures 'tis far otherwiſe, no Man ever miſt 'em that did all he could to obtain 'em, that after he had ſet himſelf ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly about 'em, uſed his utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and perſevered in doing ſo, at laſt he would moſt certainly and infallibly get 'em, if he were no way wanting to himſelf; if he were hearty and reſolved in the buſineſs, and did not by idleneſs, or ſomething elſe, break off his deſigns too ſoon, he would never fail of ſucceſs at the laſt, which ſhould be a very great encouragement to make us more diligent about thoſe Heavenly Treaſures, which have many other conſiderations to excite our induſtry and our labour about 'em, their exceeding value and laſting dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are the conſtant motives that put us upon an unwearied care and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after any thing here: What pains
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60245:82"/>do we refuſe, what labour do we count too much to get a plentifull Eſtate, that we may quickly leave, and be but a ſhort time the better for, if it may deſcend to our Children and Family; how can men deny themſelves their eaſe and their qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, nay their meat and their ſleep, and drudge and toil very willingly for that; nay, how does a poor man labour and ſweat, ſtrain his Nerves and his Muſcles to get Bread, and a mean Livelihood: Why, if we think Heaven is worth our while, do we not uſe as much labour for that, as we are willing to undergo for a leſſer matter? If the Heavenly Treaſures were but of equal worth, were but at the ſame rate with the Earthly, yet why do we not put out our utmoſt ſtrength and vigour, and ſtrive, and run, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend earneſtly for that prize? If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it to be of ſuch great worth and value, as we generally pretend, why cannot we deny our ſelves in ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle matters for the ſake of Heaven, as we do for to carry on our worldly concerns? Why do we like Children run ſo long, and ſweat and toil our ſelves after a Painted fly, whilſt we Truant and are Lazy, and Neglect our main buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>

So that ſince theſe Earthly Treaſures are ſo liable to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and uncertainties here, ſo much in danger to be torn from us by the hands of violence, or ſubject to ſome other miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance or caſualty, the beſt way to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them, and to make the moſt of 'em, is to employ 'em to Charitable uſes, and the relief of our poor Brethren; this is the ſecure way to make thoſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible things that are ſo tickliſh and uncertain, ſo apt to ſlip away from us, to be our own for ever, this will make thoſe tranſitory and periſhing Riches to laſt for ever; and whereas by keeping 'em very cloſe to our ſelves, and being unwilling to part with any of 'em, we in a ſhort time muſt be utterly deprived of 'em, by this way we return 'em to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World, and ſhall be ſure there
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60245:83"/>to enjoy the benefit of 'em, with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble intereſt; by this means the Silver and Gold that was but a better ſort of earth than we tread on, is turned into a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and made matter of true Religion, and by this we ſhow our greater value to Heavenly Treaſures, than the Earthly, when we are willing to part with them to attain the other, when they are our prime ſcope and aim, that bear the chief place in our thoughts, the other but the means and inſtruments to attain it; when we do not account the Earthly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures goods in themſelves, as the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous generally do, who think it their great Happineſs to heap up vaſt Riches for no other end beyond the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſatisfaction of being Rich, whilſt they are ſuch Idolaters, as the Apoſtle calls 'em, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. that terminate their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip upon the very Idols themſelves, and look no further; but to make 'em ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the ends of Charity and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence to thoſe who are in want and neceſſity, this is to value that in the firſt place, and thoſe chiefly in order to it, and this is the true uſe that God the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of 'em expects of us, and this is not only conſiſtent with laying up to our ſelves Treaſures in Heaven, but the moſt certain way to do it, as I ſhall briefly ſhow by naming a few conſiderations to that purpoſe.

               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:60245:83"/>
               <p n="1">1. Whatever we do this way we engage God to reward us either in this or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World. <hi>He that hath pity on the poor lendeth to the Lord, and that which he hath given will he pay again, Prov.</hi> 19.17. God becomes the poor Man's ſurety to us, and 'tis a very great piece of Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity not to truſt his word, for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a little ſum hereafter, that we now part with to the poor; nay, it ſhall be no great while before he will take care to repay it us with great advantage; he very often does it preſently in this World, by bleſſing the reſt of our Eſtate the better, for Dedicating ſome part of it as a firſt fruits to his uſe; he has promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that <hi>he which giveth to the poor ſhall not lack; Prov.</hi> 28.27. <hi>That the liberal Soul ſhall be made fat,</hi> Prov. 11.25. Eccleſ. 11.1. <hi>Caſt thy Bread upon the Waters, for thou ſhalt find it after many days.</hi> Pſ. 41.1, 2. <hi>Bleſſed is he that conſidereth the poor, the Lord will deliver him in time of trouble, the Lord will preſerve him and keep him alive, and he ſhall be bleſſed upon the Earth.</hi> All which pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces aſſure us, even of a Temporal Retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, which the Divine Providence will make to the Charitable Man, and this does for the moſt part, if not always happen, but to be ſure God will greatly recompenſe him at the laſt day.</p>

               <p n="2">2. By thus uſing our Earthly Treaſures, we enrich our Minds with the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Vertue, and the moſt Chriſtian diſpoſition, and nothing is more Valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and more Heavenly than this kind, and bountifull, and good habit of Mind, by which we are diſpos'd, as we have ability and opportunity, to do good to thoſe who ſtand any way in need of it; this is the very temper of God, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate out of his rich ſtore plentifully to others. Had he been niggardly and kept all to himſelf, where had we been, and all his Creatures that owe being, and all things to his bounty? Therefore he has commanded no duty ſo frequently, nor ſo earneſtly as this of Charity and Mercy, ſo that this often engroſſes the ſum of the whole Law, and is called Righteouſneſs in general; it is never left out in the Character of good Men in Scripture, but is always made a principal Ingredient in the Compoſition of that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Goodneſs that will prepare and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie the Mind for Heaven and Happineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We cannot make our Earthly Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſo Beneficial to us any other way, nor turn to ſo good account, if we would ſpend 'em to the beſt purpoſe; after we have ſupplied our own wants and juſt occaſions, what is over and above ſerves only for Vice or Vanity; 'tis but food
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60245:84"/>for our Luſts, nouriſhment for Pride, or Intemperance, or Senſuality; the beſt uſe we can make of the overplus, is to do good with it, to comfort our poor Brother who is ready to ſtarve for want of what we profuſely ſquander away, who would be mightily relieved and ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by what we ſpend Vainly, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Vitiouſly; thus we may both e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the temptations of Riches, and alſo make the moſt beneficial uſe of 'em another way, that which would be quite loſt, if laid out upon any thing elſe, will by this means be more fully our own, than what we have under Lock and Key, the poor will keep it ſafer for us than Locks and Bars; what is given to him, is better put out, upon a greater Intereſt and ſurer Fund, than if we had all the Land upon Earth tyed for it; God is bound, as I told you, and is become our debtor thereby; we have made over our Eſtate to him, and he is our Truſtee for it, which 'twas ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely we ſhould loſe quickly, or be robb'd, or ſequeſter'd of, if 'twere in our own name. This is the beſt Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice we can make of our ſtock, when we are in a Country where 'tis in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be ſeiz'd on, to tranſmit it to our Country, and return it to him who is in Heaven, and will moſt certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay it us when we come thither; this is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60245:85"/>to <hi>make our ſelves ſuch friends of the Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs, that when we fall they may receive us into everlaſting Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> as our Saviour ſays, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I ſhall add but this conſideration, and that I think a very ſtrong one to Men that have thoughts of a reckoning hereafter, that when we ſhall appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God's Tribunal to give an account of our ſelves and actions, there will be a moſt ſpecial regard had to the diſcharge of this duty above all others, that we ſhall be Examined and Sentenced there, chiefly upon the account of our having relieved the poor Members of Chriſt. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. where our Saviour tells us, how the proceſs ſhall be in that great day, the moſt dreadfull Sentence of <hi>Goy curſed into everlaſting fire,</hi> ſhall be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon thoſe on the left hand, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>for I was Hungry, and ye gave me no Meat; I was Thirſty, and ye gave me no Drink; I was a Stranger, and ye took me not in; Naked, and ye Cloathed me not; Sick and in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ye viſited me not.</hi> This is the particular Crime, the deepeſt Charge of that black Indictment, not ſo much for Injuſtice, for Adultery, for Murder, any of which ſhall yet condemn us at that day, as for Unmercifullneſs and Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the poor, which Chriſt takes the moſt unkindly and hardly from us, as
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60245:85"/>done to himſelf; But the bleſſed Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence ſhall be to the Bountifull and to the Mercifull, who have been Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Chriſt in his poor Members, to whom he will pronounce theſe joyfull Words, <hi>v.</hi> 34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, enter into the Kingdom prepared for you, from the beginning of the World, for I was an Hungred, and ye gave me Meat; I was Thirsty, and ye gave me Drink; I was a Stranger, and ye took me in; I was Naked, and ye Cloathed me; I was Sick, and ye vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited me; I was in Priſon and ye came unto me.</hi> This is ſingled out rather than any thing elſe, as more regarded by God, than any other Vertue; and if we would ever hear that Sentence from the mouth of Chriſt, pronounced to our ſelves, let us at all times, as we have opportunity, practice this Vertue, and ſo <hi>lay up to our ſelves Treaſures in Heaven, where neither Moth nor Ruſt doth corrupt, and where Thieves do not break through or ſteal.</hi>

               <p>This ſeemed not a juſt and a fair uſage to the elder Brother, as much failing in Juſtice to him as exceeding in kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the other, too little rewarding the conſtant duty of the one, and too much encouraging the Lewdneſs and Prodigali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the other; ſo that not without good reaſon, he ſeems to take it ill, and to be angry at this unreaſonable dealing of his Father's.</p>
               <p>Parables are very good ways of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and very lively Repreſentations of things, or truths by way of Picture or Scene, and Dramatical Hiſtory; now tho' all the parts muſt be ſuitable and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to one another, yet there is a main aim, plot, and deſign that runs thro' the whole, which was chiefly deſigned by it, and is the great ſcope of it, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things are but as the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Ornaments, the Dreſs and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, this is the air, the ſtroke that give life and likeneſs to the whole.</p>
               <p>The Parables of this Chapter concerning the loſt Sheep, the loſt piece of Silver, and the returning Prodigal, were deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſhow how acceptable and well
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60245:87"/>pleaſing to God the Repentance of a Sinner is, and that he ſhall certainly be received very kindly upon it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent this after the manner of men, in a way ſuitable and affecting to us, God who is ſaid in Scripture to be angry and provoked at Sinners, is here ſaid to Joy and Rejoyce at their Return and Repentance; The joyfull Father kiſſing and embracing his returning Son, putting the beſt robe on him, and killing the ſatted Calf for him, and receiving him with all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Mirth and Rejoycing, this is to repreſent the love and kindneſs of God to a Sinner upon his Repentance; but we muſt not apply Parables too far, for they touch not in all their parts, but only like Globes here and there in a point.</p>
               <p>Theſe Parables ſeem at firſt ſight to teach and denote, that the Repentance of a great Sinner in ſome part of his Life, is more pleaſing to God than the conſtant obedience of a good Man all his Life, which undoubtedly can never be true, and therefore the Parable can never mean that, but only by comparative and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſeending repreſentations to ſhow, that God is very well pleaſed and will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly accept a Sinner upon his true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; that expreſſion muſt not be underſtood ſtrictly and rigorouſly, <hi>There

               <p>Among the many miſtakes about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which are not a few, for we have made a ſhift to corrupt moſt of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60245:89"/>poſitive parts of our Religion, and were it not for what is Moral and Natural no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would ſecure it from being turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into meer Superſtition to ſerve the Luſts and Looſeneſs, and yet ſtupifie the fears, and delude the hopes of Men Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inclined; one, I ſay, of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſtakes is, to think a conſtant obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is not to be preferr'd to the tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Repentance, or that God will not be more pleaſed with, and more highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the one than the other; The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to which is here plainly ſuppoſed and aſſerted, <hi>Son thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine.</hi> Where plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Father who Rejoyced ſo much at the returning Prodigal, yet allows a great difference between him and his Innocent Son, who had always ſerved him, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at any time tranſgreſſed his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. To make out, and illuſtrate this, I ſhall offer the following Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are a great many I hope in the World, <hi>who,</hi> as our Saviour ſays, <hi>need no Repentance, Luke</hi> 15.7. <hi>i. e.</hi> no ſuch Repentance as is to alter their whole ſtate and ſpiritual Condition, and to change the whole Habit and Temper of their Minds, and from bad men to make them good ones; for they who by means of a good Education have been always brought
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60245:89"/>up Vertuouſly and Religiouſly and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from any great and wilfull Sin, who never erred from the paths of Vertue nor ſtept into thoſe of Sin and Death, theſe have a Title to the Character of <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Luke,</hi> 1.6. that <hi>they are Righteous before God, walking in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs,</hi> and theſe who never defiled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves need not to be waſhed and cleanſed as thoſe who have made themſelves fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and impure; they deſerve not the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter given to the vile and wretched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Scripture, nor need ſuch exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Repentance as are given to them, and which ſome very indiſcreetly apply to all alike, even in their Prayers and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, without conſidering the plain dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the caſe, ſuch as thoſe ſpoke to the wicked <hi>Jews,</hi> and whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, <hi>The whole head is ſick, and the whole heart faint, from the ſole of the foot even unto the head there is no ſoundneſs in it, but wounds and bruiſes and putrifying ſores, Iſai.</hi> 1.5, 6. and therefore thoſe were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>waſh themſelves, make themſelves clean, put away the evil of their doings,</hi> v. 16. and they were promiſed, <hi>tho' their ſins were as Scarlet, they ſhould be white as Snow, tho' they were red as Crimſon, they ſhould be as Wool,</hi> v. 18. which is great encouragement to the worſt of Sinners
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60245:90"/>to Repent, but God forbid that the ſins of all ſhould be of ſo deep a die or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſo black and ſad a Character; No, many, I hope a great many, have kept their Innocence and Whiteneſs, and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and not defil'd themſelves with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great Sin, ſince they came out of the Laver of Regeneration, and theſe are they who need no Repentance, <hi>i. e.</hi> not that great Repentance that a willfull ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner does.</p>
               <p>All ſtand in need, in daily need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in ſome ſenſe, and are to pray God to forgive them their Treſpaſſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, <hi>i. e.</hi> their leſſer Sins of frailty and infirmity, which the beſt Men are not free from, but this is very different from ſuch willfull great Sins as deſtroy a Mans good ſtate, and put him into a ſtate of Damnation and exclude him out of Heaven if he live in them; The exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and advices to Repentance in the New Teſtament as well as the Old, are given chiefly to very Vile and Lewd Sinners, and in this Senſe <hi>Chriſt came not ſo much to call the Righteous as Sinners, to Repentance.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> even the moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous amongſt them for Sanctity and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were guilty of wretched Hypocriſie and horrid Immorality, as our Saviour charges the Scribe; and Phariſees; and the Heathens before they turned Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

In the firſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> he gives ſtill a worſe and more abominable account of them, now even theſe <hi>were Waſhed, were Sanctified, were Juſtified,</hi> by becoming true Penitents and true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the ſpirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11. by <hi>putting off the old Man,</hi> i. e. the old Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Sinfull life, and <hi>putting on the new Man,</hi> i. e. a Chriſtian Converſation, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.9, 10. they who were once the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of ſin, being now <hi>made free from ſin, and become Servants of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 6.18. and <hi>they who yielded their members Servants to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs and to Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity unto Iniquity, now yielding their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

               <p>Now all this is ſpoke to thoſe who were vile ſinners, and Heathens before they became Chriſtians, and it muſt be a ſad and lamentable caſe to apply it to any that have been bred up in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, their condition muſt be much worſe and more inexcuſable, and not ſo eaſily remediable as the others, but none of this can or ought in any manner, to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to thoſe who have lived Vertuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thro' the general courſe of their lives, and have, tho' with many failings, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been ſinners in a high ſenſe, for in a low one we have all been ſo; but many I doubt not, all their lives were not in an ill ſtate, nor committed any ſin to put 'em into it, but like <hi>Enoch,</hi> walked with God all their lives, and like <hi>Job</hi> were <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright that feared God and eſchew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed evil, Job</hi> 1.1. that were always Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God and never Children of the Devil, that were never Prodigals, but always ſerved their Father, neither tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed at any time his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now the condition of theſe is a great deal more Happy and Preferable to that of the moſt Penitent ſinner, they are more in the ſavour of God, and ſhall be more highly rewarded by him; <hi>Son thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:60245:91"/>
               <p n="2">2. The difficulties and hazards and dangers are nothing ſo great to thoſe, as to penitent Sinners and Prodigals; No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo hard and difficult as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come old Vitious Cuſtoms and root out old Sinfull Habits that have been a great while growing and prevailing upon us, this is plucking out a right Eye and cutting off a right Hand, for ſins grow dear and natural to men by Cuſtom, and very hard to be parted with; like Diſeaſes that are grown Chronical, they are hard to be cured; and tho' with long Courſes and many Remedies they may be cured and aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet there will be great danger of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſome ſpices of them, now and then, and of their often returning, and the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Relapſing again into them, for there will be a diſpoſition and Inclination to them, and upon every little Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fancy and Imagination will be apt to be turned to them, and put a ſtrong byaſs upon the Mind, to carry it that way; many a good Man finds it very hard to govern the Paſſions, the deſires and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations he has given way to before he came to ſuch a full ſenſe of Religion, and how muſt a ſinner deny all his old Luſts and Affections that he has indulged ſo long, and break off the old cuſtoms and ways he has been uſed to, and be always ſtrugling with thoſe Enemies
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60245:92"/>that he has let in, ſo that they have made many ſtrong holds to themſelves, and 'tis now more hard to expell and drive them out, and tho' they are ſometimes van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht, yet they will often rally again, and a Man muſt keep a perpetual Watch and Guard againſt them; Vice, when it has once got poſſeſſion of a Man, is not eaſily caſt out, but the fancied good and the imagined pleaſure ſticks and remains in the Thoughts, Fancy, and Memory, and the Appetite is not eaſily weaned from what it has ſo long indulged, but the Luſt and Inclination is apt to kindle up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every like Object and Temptation; ſo hard and ſo rare it is to recover an old ſinner from a long habit of wickedneſs, that as Experience gives us but few Examples of this, and moſt of the good Men in the World are ſuch as were never bad, ſo that the Prophet to ſhow its great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty compares it to a natural impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Can the</hi> Aethiopian <hi>change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots, then may ye alſo do good that are accuſtomed to do evil, Jer.</hi> 13.23. but with God all things are poſſible, and he is ſaid to give a new Heart and a new Soul, and to make us new Creatures, when he brings us by his Grace to true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and 'tis a kind of <hi>creating us again to new works; a raiſing us from the dead, a quickning, a giving us a new life,</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:60245:92"/>in the Scripture phraſe, when from bad he makes us good ones, which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater than creating us at firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the other there is no hindrance and obſtacle in the ſubject, as there is in this.</p>
               <p>Many are the hardſhips and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that a ſincere Penitent finds in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an unruly Appetite, an irregular Paſſion, a beloved Luſt and Inclination, which were all made ſo by the ſtrength of Cuſtom and long Habit, and which would have been much eaſier maſtered, had they not been ſo long indulged and grown upon him. Many a ſinner when his reaſon is convinced, and he ſees the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of his ſins, and would gladly leave, if a faint wiſh would do it, yet is ſuch a ſlave to them by long Cuſtom, that they lead him Captive at their pleaſure, and he cannot break the Fetters, and ſhake off the Chains that he has made himſelf, and which are very uneaſie to him, now all this a Man is free from by an early Religion and a conſtant Obedience, and being never engaged in the ways of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, which are ſo hard to get out of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There cannot be that full comfort and ſecurity in the Return and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a ſinner as in a conſtant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken Obedience all a Man's life, for
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60245:93"/>tho' there is certain Pardon promiſed and aſſured to ſuch a Penitent, yet no Man can be ſo ſure that he has fully repented of any ſin, as that he has once committed it, but there will be ſome fears and doubts and miſgivings ſtill in his Mind, upon the remembrance of it, which he can never be ſo free from, as if he had never been guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it; and 'tis fit indeed this ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be, that a Penitent ſhould be always humble and a little afraid, and ſhould not be fully confident, as if he had been always Innocent; Fear is the neceſſary puniſhment and conſequent of ſin and guilt, and the ſinner ſhould tremble at the thoughts of God's Judgments, and the deſert of his ſin, tho' they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon him, and tho' he has his pardon ſealed in the Blood of Chriſt, yet he ought to look upon it with tears in his Eyes, and a mixture both of Joy and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; The Goſpel declares only a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pardon to thoſe who Repent, but no Man can ſee his own name particularly expreſſed in it, nor is he ſure of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny farther than he is of his Repentance, and a man of Fear and Caution, and not of Preſumption, will have ſome doubts that his Repentance is not ſo full and ſo perfect as it ought to be; and being once a Malefactor condemn'd both by God and his own Conſcience tho' he hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:60245:93"/>hopes of Pardon, yet will be more afraid to be Judged, than if his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence had wholly acquitted him, and he could never have charged himſelf with any great Crime; for that will ſtrike him with more certain fear than he can have certain hopes of his particular pardon.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Neither ſhall ſuch a penitent be ſo much in God's favour, or ſo highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by him, as a Man of more conſtant and greater Vertues: This is a Rule I think of eternal Juſtice, and follows from God's <hi>rendring to all Men according to their works,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks, which would not be if there were not a proportion of the reward to the work, as well as a reward in general. God indeed out of his great Grace, will accept a great ſinner upon his Repentance, and receive him into his favour, and paſs by and forgive his paſt offences. But 'tis his becoming a good Man qualifies and entitles him to this; for God can love no other; and the more any is a good Man, the more he will be beloved by him, and the more highly rewarded at the laſt day: 'tis great Mercy and Favour in God, and what Chriſt has purchaſed for us, to accept of an imperfect and after goodneſs, and broken obedience, inſtead of what is whole and entire, which is his due; and not puniſh us for our paſt Sins and Diſobedience
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60245:94"/>after we have left them, as he might do in ſtrict Juſtice; but ſtill 'tis only our Obedience and Goodneſs which (being after our Diſobedience and Sin is called Repentance) is acceptable and pleaſing to God, and it would be more ſo, had it been more conſtant, unbroken, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted; and 'tis only for that as a Qualification and Condition in our ſelves, for which he will reward us, and the more and greater that is, the greater ſhall be our reward.</p>
               <p>Indeed in caſe a Penitent is after his ſins brought to love much and to obey much, and to be more abundantly Zealous in good works, and doing his duty, to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends as much as he is able for his paſt fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures, and repair the Divine Honour, and expreſs his Gratitude for the Mercy ſhown him, and ſo takes care to riſe to higher degrees of Vertue, and perform more ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal acts of Obedience; ſo that his fall makes him riſe higher, and he redeems his loſs with greater gain and improving more in Grace and Goodneſs afterwards: this ſhall entitle him to greater rewards, and to God's ſpecial favour; not barely becauſe he Repented, but becauſe upon his Repentance, he became a better Man, and went faſter, and made more progreſs in the ways of Vertue, after he had got into them; but he that never wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60245:94"/>out of them, nor never ſtray'd into the ways of Sin, but always kept on in the path of Vertue, which he was early entred into, is a thouſand times more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to go farther, and make a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in Vertue, and attain to higher degrees and improvements of it, than the other; and conſequently to be more highly rewarded by God, the impartial Judge and diſtributer of rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments at the laſt day. There are ſeveral manſions in our Father's houſe, and ſeveral degrees of Glory in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven: thoſe who have been more conſtantly and more highly Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Obedient, or have done or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered more for Chriſt and his Religion; theſe ſhall have Crowns of greater weight and brightneſs, and ſhall ſhine in a higher Orb, among thoſe Stars of Heaven, who differ from one and another in Glory, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different Virtues and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments.</p>
               <p n="5">5. This makes us more truly Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and more the Children of God, and live more anſwerably to the Ends and Deſigns of our Religion; for tho' Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is to reſtore and recover loſt and undone mankind, and does it chiefly by the benefit of Repentance, which is the great Duty and the great Privilege of the Goſpel, which upon the account of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60245:95"/>Chriſt and his undertaking for us, puts ſinners into a good ſtate, a ſtate of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Reconciliation with God, who were Enemies to him before, and makes thoſe the Children of God, who were the Children of the Devil; for all Men in a ſtate of Sin are the Children of the Devil in the Scriptures account, <hi>He that commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Sin is of the Devil,</hi> 1 John 3.8. and <hi>whoſoever is born of God,</hi> as every good Chriſtian is, <hi>doth not commit Sin,</hi> v. 9.</p>
               <p>Repentance therefore, which is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from a ſtate of Sin and Death, to a ſtate of Vertue and Holineſs, is truly and properly rather a duty antecedent and diſpoſing to Chriſtianity, than one under it; and therefore it was Preach'd both to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as previous and preparatory to their becoming Chriſtians, <hi>Repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> Mat. 4.17. <hi>Repent and be Baptized,</hi> Acts 2.38. for before Men turned Chriſtians they were ſuppoſed to Repent of their paſt Sins, and to reſolve upon a new courſe of life, to renounce all their former evil ways, to <hi>put off the old Man, i. e.</hi> all their old acts and habits of Sin, and to <hi>put on the new Man,</hi> and to <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> and not to walk henceforth as others, who were not Chriſtians walked; for tho' they were accounted as ſinners before, yet now they
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60245:95"/>were to be Saints, devoted to a Holy life and wholly abandoning all Vice and Wickedneſs, according to their Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal vow. It was far therefore from the deſign of Chriſtianity to ſuppoſe Men to fall into a ſtate of Sin after their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and to be as bad and as wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as they were before they were Chriſtians; if they were, and fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any great Sins, the Chriſtian Church at firſt turned them out of its Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion as Apoſtates to their Religion, and Renegado's to their Holy Profeſſion; and would not without great difficulty admit them again to the benefits of Chriſtianity and hopes of Pardon: ſo that they accounted not thoſe for Chriſtians who were Penitents and who ſtood in need of Repentance for any great Sin; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he is not a Chriſtian who does ſo, he is fallen off from his Chriſtianity, and has quitted his Baptiſmal vow, and has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited the right of it, and has put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf out of the Chriſtian ſtate, who is guilty of any mortal Sin, and is in a ſtate of Penance for it; and the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church at firſt would hardly have owned and received him again; no, not in <hi>Articulo Mortis:</hi> ſo great a diſgrace, and ſo horrid a reflection they thought it upon Chriſtianity, for a Chriſtian to be guilty of any willfull and notorious
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60245:96"/>Sin: I confeſs this early Diſcipline was too ſevere, never to admit ſuch a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent again to Communion, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if no Sins were pardonable after Baptiſm; which is a hard and untrue Doctrine, and therefore the Church alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its firſt Diſcipline, and condemned the <hi>Novatians</hi> who ſtuck too cloſe to it, and who would allow the Church no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to grant the benefit of Repentance and Communion in that caſe, whatever God might do; but upon relaxing the Canons too far, and falling afterwards into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extream, upon the looſeneſs and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Chriſtians, and their degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from the Primitive ſtrictneſs and genuine deſign of Chriſtianity, Repentance when it came to be turned into a ſlight Penance, became a very common and perfunctory and eaſie matter; and Men began the round of Sinning and Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Repenting and Sinning, and of taking it as a ſort of ſtanding Phyſick, to be repeated <hi>toties quoties,</hi> and took perhaps at ſome ſet times, or Spring and Fall; and that this was ſufficient, tho' they lived in their Vices and Debaucheries, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Liberties, and never became ſuch good Men and true Chriſtians, as the Goſpel was deſigned to make them. Now this is like a Man's always uſing Phyſick, but never to be well, and only to do it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60245:96"/>that he may keep his Diſeaſe, and it may not as he thinks, prove mortal to him (when he is loth to take away the cauſe of it) by virtue of a preſent and eaſie Remedy. Now this is horribly pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abuſing the Notion and Deſign of Chriſtian Repentance, which is not a Contrivance to let us be bad Men, and live in our Sins, and yet hope for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Salvation upon a little ſudden Sorrow, miſcalled Repentance, now and then for them; but to encourage us whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to leave them upon the hopes and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Pardon when we do ſo, and to engage us to the practice of Obedience and a Holy Life ever after, which is the only thing which makes us true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and entitles to the Happineſs and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of another World. And let no man deceive himſelf, and think he ſhall have the benefit of Repentance, who is not made a good Man by it; or think Repenting and Sorrowing at the laſt will do the buſineſs, inſtead of a good life; or that without actual Holineſs and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, he can ſee God or enter into Heaven: and let none fall into that other miſtake, as prejudicial to Religion, to think a man that lives Innocently and Vertuouſly, and Religiouſly all his days, and performs a conſtant unbroken Obedience to God all his life, ſhall not be more accepted
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60245:97"/>by God, and more highly rewarded by him, than he that has lived wickedly and been a Prodigal, tho' he Returns and Repents in time, and is pardoned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by God; for tho' ſuch an one ſhall be kindly and graciouſly received by his Heavenly Father, and with all Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of Love and Compaſſion, be Embraced and Treated by him, and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be his Son, and received again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Family; yet he that never left his Father's houſe, but was always with him and ſerved him, and never tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs'd at any time his commands, he it is of whom it will be ſaid, <hi>Son, thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall only draw a few inferences from what has been ſaid, and ſo conclude.</p>

This allows all that is due to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and all the Encouragements and Motives to it: Repentance is the great Goſpel Medicine, the Cure for our greateſt Sins, and the moſt mortal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of the Soul, if it be compounded as it ought and taken in time; if it be made up not only of ſorrow for what is paſt, and good purpoſes and reſolutions for the future, but of actual Amendment and Reformation, <hi>Turning away from our wickedneſs that we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and doing that which is Lawfull and Right</hi> afterwards, then 'tis ſuch an
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60245:97"/>effectual and never failing Remedy as by the merits of it, and the Grace of the Goſpel will take off the greateſt and vileſt Sins, that the worſt ſinner ever fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; but ſtill, tho' the Medicine is Good and Infallible for every Diſeaſe, yet 'tis much better to be always well and have an intire and perfect health, than often to need it, or make uſe of it; for tho' the goodneſs of it be never ſo great, yet 'tis but in order to an end, which is to recover health that was loſt, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore us to that ſoundneſs that we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>'Tis the great Mercy of God, and the great Grace and Favour of the Goſpel, and the great Purchaſe of Chriſt's Blood, to have the Privilege of Repentance granted to Sinners, in ſo large and full a manner, ſo as to be reſtored to God's Favour and reconciled to him upon their return, as if they had never offended him; to have all the guilt and puniſhment of their paſt Sins wholly taken off, as if they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver committed them; to be <hi>recti in curia,</hi> pardoned, and in as good ſtate as if they had been always Innocent: This ſhould mightily encourage and prevail upon Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Repent and leave their Sins when they are ſure of this, as they are by the Goſpel; When <hi>tho' their Sins be as Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, they ſhall be white as Snow; tho they
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60245:98"/>were red like Crimſon, they ſhould be as Wool,</hi> as the Evangelical Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.18. <hi>i. e.</hi> tho' they were ſins of the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Die, or higheſt Nature, yet they ſhould be wholly done away and forgiven upon true Repentance, from which no Perſon is excluded.</p>
               <p>How muſt this encourage the greateſt Sinners if they have any ſenſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or another World left upon 'em, to come off from their Sins? how comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able muſt it be to a poor wretch, lying under the ſenſe of his own guilt, and the fears and horrors of his own Conſcience, and the dread of God's Judgments, and of Eternal Miſery, to have theſe glad Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings proclaimed to him? how will this revive his deſponding Soul, and chear his ſunk Spirit, and like a pardon brought to a Condemned Malefactor, in the Cart, or upon the Gibbet, reſtore him to life and to unſpeakable joy and gladneſs? Now this is offered to every Sinner by the Goſpel, if he repent and turn from his Sins however great they have been, and lead a new life, and become a new Man, and a new Creature before he dies; What can be deſired more by any reaſonable Creature? or what more can God offer? Would any deſire to live and go on in his Sins, and yet be forgiven? This is for God to give up his Laws, his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60245:98"/>and to grant a Liberty to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to be Rebellious and Diſobedient, and have no Check or Controul upon them; 'tis the utmoſt a good God can grant, or a wicked man can deſire, to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned upon his Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but his Repenting and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is with ſorrow for what is paſt, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his duty for the future as he ought always to have done it, performing that Obedience which he ought always to have performed; and now this is the beſt thing next to the having done it and performed it always, but it can by no means be thought to be ſo good as that. Repenting is like a Man's ſetting up again, that was once broke, and compounding with his Creditors, and paying a part he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them inſtead of the whole; God is pleaſed to accept of the broken, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience of a Sinner for ſome part of his Life, inſtead of that entire and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken one which is due from him all his life. 'Tis God's great Grace and Mercy to do this, and what he is no way obliged to, for he might have damned us for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very willfull ſin, and never have pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us tho' we had afterwards Repented of it; this is meer free Grace which we owe to Chriſt and the Goſpel, and God was no way obliged to it, either in Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice or by his natural Goodneſs, but he
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60245:99"/>might have denied it to mankind as he has done to other of his Creatures, the Devils and the fallen Angels: but ſtill the deſign of God in granting us this Favour and this mighty privilege by the Goſpel is to encourage us to Obedience, to perſwade us to leave our Sins and to bring us to true Holineſs and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Life, when we have been faulty and defective in theſe before; 'tis not to encourage us in our Sins, or give us any Licence or Diſpenſation to commit 'em; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we may Repent of them; this is a horrid abuſe and perverting the Grace of the Goſpel and turning it into Wantonneſs and Looſeneſs: but the End and Deſign of all this is to make thoſe good men who have been Sinners, to make thoſe Obedient who have been Diſobedient, either in general or any inſtance. Now therefore 'tis much better to have been always thus, to have been always Good and always Obedient thro' the whole courſe of our lives; this is the beſt thing and the very ſame End more fully and perfectly attained; this is deſigned by Repentance: As Health is the deſign of taking Phyſick, and to be well, and ſound, of uſing Remedies and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; and thoſe who are always healthfull, and always ſound, and always well, are in a much better condition than thoſe who ſtand
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60245:99"/>in need of a Cure, tho' it be never ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and infallible.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I ſpeak this all the while of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance from great and wilfull ſins, from a habit of them in our lives, or at leaſt a voluntary practice of them at ſome time or other; and this Repentance, I hope, there are many that need not, who were never ill perſons all their lives, nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver guilty of any ſuch one great and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin, as ſhould put them into an ill and damnable ſtate, and exclude them out of Heaven, had they died. I ſpeak not now of the ill ſtate of all mankind by the fall, or by our original Corruption and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation; for that is took off by Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> and we are put into a good ſtate by the Goſpel and by our Baptiſm, ſo that no Man is in any danger of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but upon his committing ſome wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and known ſins, ſuch as the Scripture declares are damnable, and exclude from Heaven: He therefore that has been free from thoſe, tho' not free from all ſins, which no man is or can be all his life, no, not in his beſt ſtate, but ſome Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, ſome Imperfection, ſome ſin of Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or Ignorance, or Surprize will beſet him; He, I ſay, that has lived free from all wilfull known ſins, and not allowed himſelf in any voluntary breach of God's Laws, tho' he has not kept them ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60245:100"/>and exactly as he ought to do; but has always had a regard to Religion and his Duty, and never violated them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great inſtance; he was always a Child of God and never forfeited that Title, he was never a Prodigal and run away from his Father's houſe, nor waſted his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in Riotous living, but like the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull and elder Son always ſerved his Father, neither at any time tranſgreſs'd his Commandments: He never wandered out of the paths of Vertue, nor never let his ſteps take hold of death; he never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd his Virgin Innocence, nor ſullied and blemiſh'd his Baptiſmal Purity; nor fell into, nor wallowed in any great ſin, and ſo needeth not to be waſhed and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and puriſied as a ſinner in a higher ſenſe needeth; and this is the Happy the Bleſſed Perſon, whom I prefer to the beſt Penitent and the trueſt Convert, as the Parable here does.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This ſhows the good of early Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and the great Happineſs and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a Vertuous and Religious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, and the great Obligation there is for Parents to take care of this, and the great thankfullneſs, which thoſe owe to God, and their Parents, who have had the benefit of it: for nothing makes Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion ſo eaſie or ſo accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us as to have them taught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60245:100"/>into us in our tender year<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> when like ſoft Wax, we are capable of any impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and yet grow hard and retain them afterwards. When the Seeds of Virtue are early Planted in our hearts, before Viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Habits or Inclinations are grown up in them, and a ſenſe of Religion takes the firſt poſſeſſion of us, and anticipates and prevents the power of our own Luſts or of evil Examples; then Virtue becomes natural to us, and Cuſtom makes it both very eaſie to be practis'd and hard to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome: for let the Habit and Cuſtom be equal, and I doubt not but there is as much difficulty for a Vertuous Perſon to become Vitious, as for a Vitious Perſon to be made Vertuous: It muſt be with great violence and reluctancy that ſuch an one is brought to commit a wilfull Sin, as well as the other to forſake it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Scripture repreſents both the one and the other as if they were morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: As they who are accuſtomed to do Evil, can as hardly learn to do Good, as the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> can change his Skin or the Leopard his Spots, ſo <hi>he that is born of God cannot Sin,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. I doubt not therefore but moſt of the good men that are, or ever were in the World, are ſuch as have been Vertuouſly and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly Educated and brought up; and but few of thoſe in proportion who have been
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60245:101"/>otherwiſe, have been reclaim'd and brought off from the Lewdneſs and Debauchery they contracted when they were young. Tis a very hard and difficult thing to make a bad Man a good one, the hardeſt thing in the World, what the powerfull Operation of God's Grace is neceſſary to, and what it often cannot effect, thro' the ſtubbornneſs of the Will, and indiſpoſition of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; hence thoſe complaints and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, <hi>I would have healed them but they would not be healed,</hi> Jerem. 51.9. <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die? Oh, that my people would have hearkned unto me,</hi> and of Sinners <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, grieving, and quenching the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and that <hi>God's Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with them,</hi> and the like; which ſhows the ſtrength and power of ill habits, and how hard 'tis even by all means to get rid of them; and how much happier it is to be engaged in an early Obedience and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by a Vertuous Education, than to be afterwards ſtruggling with them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This prevents the common and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous miſtakes about Repentance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Men make it a reſerve to themſelves to excuſe them from a Religious and Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Holy life; and think that by means of that they ſhall avoid all the miſchief of their ſins at laſt, and be as ſafe and as ſecure of Heaven and their eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, tho' they live never ſo looſely and
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60245:101"/>careleſly, as if their whole lives had been ſpent in a courſe of Vertue and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 'Tis but Repenting before they die, and that as little before as they can, if they can nick it right, and are not cut off ſuddenly and unexpectedly, which is but an accident that happens only to few, and the great work and buſineſs is done, by a true Sorrow and ſome ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Reſolutions, and an Inſtantaneous change of mind, as well as by the moſt intire Vertue and conſtant Obedience of a Man's whole life. If ſo, moſt Men's Sins and Luſts will perſwade 'em to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge and gratify 'em the greateſt part of their lives; if they cannot wholly bring 'em off from a ſenſe and belief of Religion, they will thus corrupt Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and make it thereby comply with them; and by theſe falſe notions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, raiſe hopes to themſelves of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping all the miſchief of their Sins and their ill lives, and ſaving themſelves by virtue of this Repentance at the laſt, without leading a good life, which they will therefore be glad to excuſe themſelves from, as not abſolutely neceſſary; and ſo wholly truſt and depend and venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other way. Now this is putting a trick upon God and Religion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too hard for 'em upon their own Terms (as they think) tho' it is indeed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60245:102"/>putting a trick upon themſelves and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably deluding themſelves into deſtruction; by thus abuſing this privilege of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and making this Grant and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Goſpel to deſtroy the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel it ſelf, and all the deſign of it, which was to make men live well, and bring them off from their Sins, and not at all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them in 'em; whereas by thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Grace of the Goſpel, and by wrong notions and wretched miſtakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Repentance, the Obligations to actual Holineſs and Obedien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> are taken off, and a Man may ſecure Heaven, and his own Salvation without thoſe by another and much ſhorter and eaſier way; which is by Repentance at the laſt, which ſhall be as ſafe to our ſelves, and as acceptable to God, and as well rewarded by him as the other. Now I know but one way of ſaving a Man's Soul and going to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that is by a good life and by actual Holineſs and Obedience; Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the bringing a ſinner to theſe; and if he do not do this, tho' the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row be never ſo great, it is not true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance nor will be effectual to his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; 'tis the Obedience and Holineſs that he performs after his Diſobedience and Wickedneſs, which conſtitutes and compleats his Repentance and entitles him to the Divine favour and acceptance, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60245:102"/>to the rewards of Heaven and another World; and the greater and perfecter and more entire this Obedience hath been, the more it will be accepted, and the more rewarded by a Righteous and Juſt God, who will be Mercifull to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners when they Repent and turn to their Duty and Obedience, and will accept and reward their broken and imperfect Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; but not in ſo high a degree as the conſtant and unbroken and early and entire Obedience of Vertuous and Good men all their lives.</p>
               <p>Laſtly this Notion of an early Virtue and conſtant Obedience being prefertable to the trueſt Repentance, ſtands upon the plaineſt principles of Religion and ſecures thoſe evident Doctrines, upon which all Practical Religion and the obligations of it are built; ſuch as theſe, that God <hi>will reward every one</hi> at the laſt day <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their works,</hi> and therefore in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to them, and therefore thoſe who have <hi>ſowed plenteouſly ſhall reap plente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,</hi> and that nothing but actual Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Obedience can fit us to ſee God and enter into Heaven, and make us meet, and qualify us for the inheritance of the Saints in light. Theſe are ſuch plain and undeniable principles both from Reaſon and Scripture, that no Doctrine which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes them and is inconſiſtent with them,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60245:103"/>can be true; and therefore a late and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Repentance that brings forth no fruits of Obedience, cannot be ſufficient for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as not coming up to thoſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are abſolutely requir'd by the Goſpel to make us capable of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; ſince none but good Men, who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther always were ſo, or at leaſt, who become ſuch after they were otherwiſe, can go to Heaven; and the more good and the more obedient and vertuous any Man hath been in his life, the greater and higher rewards he ſhall have in another World, for <hi>as one Star differeth from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Star in Glory, ſo alſo ſhall it be at the Reſurrection of the dead,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, where ſome ſhall ſhine in a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Orb, and with greater Luſtre, and have Crowns of greater weight and brightneſs, who have either done or ſuffer'd more for Chriſt and God and Religion than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: and therefore they who have been more conſtantly and more highly Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous all their lives, ſhall be more high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rewarded by a Juſt and Righteous God in that Heavenly Kingdom, where Chriſt tells us <hi>are many Manſions,</hi> and where no doubt are ſeveral degrees of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, according to Mens ſeveral Actions and Vertues. Tho' the Penitent and the Prodigal ſhall upon their return be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into their Father's houſe, and be
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60245:103"/>kindly embraced and entertain'd by him; yet their Portion ſhall not be equal to the Son that was always Dutifull and always Obedient, <hi>Son thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine.</hi> God grant that all good Men may ſo perſevere in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Obedience, and all Sinners may ſo timely Repent and be brought off from their Sins, that we may all in due time be received into thoſe Manſions of Joy, where all Sin ſhall be done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and there ſhall be no more Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and all Virtue and Obedience Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Glory and Immortality, thro' Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>

               <p>THis great queſtion is ask'd by one in great trouble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, when he was affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the night by a ſudden Earth-quake, which ſhook the Foundations of the Houſe or Priſon where he was, v. 27. and ſo he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened into a ſenſe of preſent danger, and this brought him to conſider what was future and greater. God does often rowſe up Men's ſleepy and ſenſeleſs and <hi>Lethargic</hi> Minds, by ſome preſent Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, Judgment, or Affliction, which brings them to conſider the concerns of their Souls and an another World, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60245:105"/>elſe will: This ſhakes off their thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſecurity, and alarms their ſtupid and unthinking Minds, to look about them, and ſee what a dangerous condition they are in; and fear is a very proper princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for beginning Religion; it's one of the greateſt paſſions that belong to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and then there is a good ground for it, and it only opens our Eyes to let us ſee a real danger, that ſo we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void it, and keep out of it: It is very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and a great branch of that ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, which is a principle that lies at the root of our very beings; had we no ſenſe of an Evil coming upon us, we ſhould run into it blindfold, and leap down the precipice we did not ſee, which would be never the leſs hurtfull to us; when fear indeed makes a danger where there is none, or repreſents it greater than it is, when it frights the mind with fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied Spectres and imaginary Mormo's, or makes it afraid of its own ſhadow, it's then a weak, a mean, an unmanly Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: but when the danger is real and great and likely, it's ſtupid blindneſs not to ſee it, and raſh madneſs for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to run upon it. The concerns of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World are both certain and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, and he whoſe Mind has no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable fear or juſt dread and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them, is like <hi>Damocles</hi> with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60245:105"/>and pointed Sword hanging over his head by a ſingle hair, but he ſits ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and does not ſee it. The evils and dangers of a future ſtate are very terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and may be, as far as we know, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near us; and they are never the leſs near, nor never the leſs real for our not believing, or not having a ſenſe of them. It's very happy therefore if our fear awakens us to conſider of them, whilſt we have means and opportunity to take care to prevent them; that before we feel them we think of them, and do not like <hi>Dives,</hi> then lift up our Eyes when we are in the midſt of Torments: it's then too late to have a ſenſe of them, when we cannot get out of them. A wiſe man would therefore ſo conſider them before-hand, either out of a juſt fear or dread of them, or from a wiſe care and concern for his own Happineſs, that whether any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary providence ſtartl'd his Mind, or it were more freely left to its own thoughts, yet it ſhould frequently and ſeriouſly ask it ſelf this queſtion, <hi>what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> To be ſaved is ſtrictly to be delivered from a great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger we were likely to fall into, to be ſnatch'd like a fire-brand out of the fire, and like one that was ſinking to be catch'd hold on and preſerved; but it alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes in it a poſitive Salvation as well
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60245:106"/>as a negative, and ſo comprehends that Happineſs which is contrary to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery we are ſecured from; he who is ſaved from death gains life by that means, and he who is ſaved from Hell gains Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſo both are meant and inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the word Salvation: I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider at preſent the great importance of this queſtion, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved;</hi> and ſecondly, the true anſwer and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to it. Firſt, of the importance of it: and it is certainly the greateſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to us in the World, how we may be delivered from the dangers and evils of the next World, and how we may eſcape, as the Scripture ſpeaks, the Wrath to come, and ſo ſecure to our ſelves that eternal Good and Happineſs, which we call Heaven. We can none of us expect to live always here; there muſt be a time, and we know not how ſoon, but we are ſure it's not very long, when we muſt take leave of this World and all that is in it; and it concerns us to think what ſhall become of us when that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal minute ſhall come, as it certainly will, that ſhall make this body of ours a cold lump, and put an end to all our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Enjoyments; When darkneſs and the ſhadow of death ſhall let down the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and put an end to all theſe lower Scenes, and to all the Actions of this life,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60245:106"/>we cannot think there is then an end of our being; hardly any of mankind ever thought ſo, our own thoughts tell us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and Revelation aſſures us to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and we have as much Evidence as we can have, till we come thither, as is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with Faith, and comes not up to Senſe. We cannot then but be very ſollicitous, what ſhall become of our naked Souls when they are ſtript of theſe fleſhly Bodies, and what condition they ſhall be in in the other world: We know in general how different the ſtate is there; there are Joys unſpeakable on the one hand, and Torments intolerable on the other; and according as we believe the greatneſs and reality of both thoſe, ſo muſt we be concerned about this queſtion, <hi>How we ſhall be ſaved?</hi> That is, how we ſhall obtain the one and avoid the other. We are very carefull here to make a ſhort life that we know will quickly be at an end, as Comfortable and Happy as we can; We toil and drudge and contrive all we can to acquire the few good things that belong to it, and to keep off thoſe evils that are uneaſie to us; and yet when we have done all, we can never hope to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Happy here, and our utmoſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment can be only this that we be but leſs miſerable; we riſe early and go to bed late, and eat the bread of carefull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs rather than ſuffer want and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60245:107"/>and we are at infinite pains and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to gain an Eſtate that we muſt quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leave, and whilſt we have it, we are not more happy, perhaps leſs content than we were before; we are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to keep up our crazy Bodies in good repair, tho' we know they muſt quickly decay and fall into the duſt. A Diſeaſe alarms us, and we are concerned at the warning of death, and are willing to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure almoſt any thing to prevent it, that its a Suffering a greater Martyrdom for this life than ever Chriſtian did for another: but how much greater reaſon have we to be concerned for our future ſtate; that life is never to have any end and ſo we ſhou'd be more carefull about it; it's to continue to Eternity, and what it once is, it's to be ever the ſame; if it be happy, it's ſo unalterably without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of changing; and if it be miſerable, it's irreverſibly ſo without any hopes of relief. Oh, wonderfull ſtate, how is this life a ſhadow, a dream, a vapour, a bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, a vaniſhing Nothing in reſpect of the other! it deſerves not a thought, nor is it worth a thouſandth part of that care the other is; how fooliſh are we then to labour ſo much for a moment of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not be more concerned for an endleſs duration of it? But the greatneſs of the thing is as conſiderable as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60245:107"/>the things we are ſaved from are the greateſt and terribleſt evils we can poſſibly ſuffer, the utmoſt torments of Mind and Body, deſpair and horror and a dreadfull ſenſe of Divine Anger and Vengeance, and all the terrible apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that guilt within and puniſhment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out can bring upon a Soul that can have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to fly to; and that muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer greater torment day and night with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermiſſion, than we can have now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny conception of. Fire and Brimſtone and Chains of darkneſs, and a never dying worm, are but leſſer repreſentations of the unſpeakable miſery in the other World; and who is it that dreads a nights pain under a tormenting deſpair, that knows the torments of a troubled mind, or has but taſted the gall and bitterneſs of a Melancholick humour, who would not be infinitely concern'd, how he may be ſav'd from what we mean by Hell and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? and what would not the hopes of Heaven, when they are joyned with thoſe fears, make us farther do, when the one is to fright us from the greateſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and the moſt perfect miſery, and the other at the ſame time holds out and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites us to the greateſt Happineſs, to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pleaſures, and Joy unſpeakable? Who that does not either ſecretly diſ-believe, or never conſider of this, would not think
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60245:108"/>it the greateſt Queſtion in the World, <hi>what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> And who would not do all he can, and uſe all means that are in his power to this purpoſe? Who would refuſe any pains or labour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this great End? Who would ſtick at any difficulty that he was able to overcome and ſurmount to gain this point, this greateſt point of his own E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation? Had God required us to have toiled all our lives in the moſt weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom drudgery, and to have ſpent all our days in the hardeſt ſlavery; had he made Religion the greateſt burden and uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the World, in order to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of this, yet what Wiſe man would not have thought it worth his while to have endured it, and gone through it? Had he commanded us to deny every Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, to have offered violence to every inclination, to have ſtifl'd every natural deſires and renounced all the Gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Enjoyments of the Animal life; had he obliged us to quit all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this World, and to have retir'd into a barren Wilderneſs, or a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholick Cloiſter, and there have worn out our lives in the ſevereſt Exerciſes of Faſting and Mortification, or to have made them one continued ſtation, one conſtant courſe of Penance and Devotion; all this would have been much more tolerable than
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60245:108"/>to have endured the far greater Evils and Miſeries of another World, tho but for a little time, and for much leſs than half ſo long as this life, and therefore a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more ſo, than to ſuffer a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Eternity. What ſhall we think then of God's requiring no ſuch hard things at our hands, nothing but what is far leſs than any of thoſe, nothing that is extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hard or mighty difficult, or very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome and uneaſie to us, nothing but what is truly comfortable and delightfull if we rightly underſtood it, and what tends to our preſent Good, Eaſe and Comfort, Intereſt and Advantage, even in this life as well as another? God puts no ſuch hard conditions upon us as thoſe I mention'd, but we may be ſaved hereafter, and yet enjoy at preſent all the comforts and good things of this World, that a Wiſe Man would deſire; Religion debars us of none of them, ſo far as they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and Lawfull, that is, ſo far as they are not Evil and Miſchievous to us, and plainly Deſtructive both of our own good and the good of the World. There is no natural good forbidden to us, nor any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to be denied any farther than it is fooliſh and unreaſonable and exceeds the bounds of Wiſdom and Virtue; nor has God reſtrained us from any thing but what like the forbidden fruit is poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60245:109"/>as well as pleaſant, and it's not the pleaſantneſs but the poyſon is the true reaſon why it is forbidden: ſo that our future Happineſs is very conſiſtent with our preſent, and true Godlineſs may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the promiſes of this life, as well as of another, as the Scriptures aſſure us, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. It is not neceſſary to part with our preſent Happineſs, in order to the purchaſing the Reverſion of that in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, tho' if it were it would be great gain and advantage to us; there is but one inſtance in Religion wherein this is to be done, and that is in ſuffering per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for Chriſt's ſake and the Goſpels, in quitting all our Worldly Intereſts for the ſake of Conſcience and Religion, and rather endure any evils here, than to renounce Chriſt or any true part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity: this indeed is bearing the Croſs, and is the only hard part of Religion, for which there ſhall be an abundant recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe hereafter; and the hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of that with the preſent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Satisfaction of Mind, takes off from the burden and uneaſineſs of it; and tho' without hopes of another life, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might be of all Men moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this, when they fall under thoſe Circumſtances, as the Apoſtle ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. yet with thoſe hopes they are far from being ſo, but with exception to that
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60245:109"/>particular caſe which does not often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Religion at the ſame time ſecures to us the greateſt Happineſs of this life as well as another, and without loſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Comfort or true Enjoyment of this World, we may make ſure of the next. We may therefore put that queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to our ſelves, which is ſomething like to that which <hi>Naaman</hi>'s Servants put to him 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.13. Had God bid us do ſome great thing that we might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, would we not have done it? how much rather then when he bids us do nothing elſe in order to this, but what is very reaſonable and what tends to our Good here, as well as our Salvation hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; We muſt be therefore very bad judges of our own intereſt, and very little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that, and ſo be very regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of our ſelves, as well as very ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the great God, if we do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with whatever he has Wiſely and Graciouſly appointed us in order to our Salvation. What that is, I ſhall now brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, and ſo give the true reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this queſtion, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> And it is not very hard to reſolve it, God has not made it any difficult or abſtruſe thing to underſtand, but the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Chriſtian may eaſily comprehend it; it's not a Secret reſerved only for the Wife and Learned, but the pooreſt Soul
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60245:110"/>if it be but ſincere and honeſt, may come to the true knowledge of it, and there is hardly any without it, tho' it may lie leſs clear and diſtinct in their thoughts; Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light teaches all men that ſuch and ſuch Actions are diſpleaſing to God, and that thoſe who commit them ſhall be puniſhed hereafter. There is no Man who is guilty of any great wickedneſs but he finds ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward apprehenſions of this in his own Mind, and his own Conſcience directs him in great meaſure what he muſt do to be faved; but Revelation has made this ſo plain and evident, that a Man muſt uſe great Art to deceive himſelf, if he ever miſtake it; to believe the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and live according to it, is ſo plain a path-way to Heaven, that there is no Chriſtian but muſt ſee it: and if he thinks of any other, he cannot but know that he cheats himſelf, and willfully puts a trick upon his own Soul. St. <hi>Paul</hi> here told tho Jailor, <hi>That he muſt believe on the Lord Jeſu Chriſt, and he ſhould be ſaved, v.</hi> 31. but this belief which is made the condition and means of Salvation muſt include all that which is conſequent and ought to follow from ſuch a belief; all that Obedience to the Laws of Chriſt, and that Repentance for paſt Sins, and Newneſs and Holineſs of life, which is made as plain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible a condition of Salvation as
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60245:110"/>Faith it ſelf; and therefore St. <hi>Peter</hi> in anſwer to the ſame queſtion to thoſe who were greatly concern'd and prick'd in heart, and ſaid, <hi>Men and Brethren what ſhall we do? Acts.</hi> 2.37. anſwered, <hi>Repent and be Baptized every one of you in the name of Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Believing and embracing Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was the only way for a <hi>Jew</hi> or a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then</hi> to be ſaved, and to have remiſſion of Sins; and when St. <hi>Peter</hi> bids them Repent, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids them Believe, they mean the ſame thing: Faith is the firſt great Principle and Foundation of Repentance and all Chriſtian Vertues; and therefore as including and containing all thoſe it is made the condition of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaved by a Metonymy, whereby the cauſe comprehends alſo the effect. Faith in Scripture is not taken only for an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to another's Words, or a truſt in them; but it denotes a principle that worketh by love, and is manifeſt by good works, without which the Scripture expreſly ſays it is dead; and then it muſt be a ſtrange mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake to make a bare faith the condition of our Juſtification and Salvation.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved, and I think it may be a little uſefull, to clear that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; that when Faith and Believing is made the only condition of being ſaved, and nothing elſe is mention'd, this is
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60245:111"/>always ſpoken to thoſe who were not yet Chriſtians or Believers, as when Chriſt ſays, <hi>John</hi> 3.15. <hi>Whoſoever believeth on the Son of Man, ſhall not periſh but have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Life:</hi> This is ſpoken to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> who then expreſt his diſ-belief of Chriſt's words, and was not brought ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to believe in him, tho' he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for it? So <hi>John</hi> 6.40. when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him, may have everlaſting Life:</hi> This is ſpoken to the <hi>Jews,</hi> who mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured at Chriſt, and were far from believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in him: and ſo Chriſt bid the Apoſtles preach this to the unbelieving World, <hi>Whoſoever believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16.16. <hi>i.e.</hi> Believing and Profeſſing Chriſtianity puts them into a ſalvable ſtate, and if they live according to this faith, they ſhall certainly be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; as if we ſhould ſay to a perſon who deſires to know how he may be a Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, Go to School or to the Univerſity; this would put him into a certain way to Learning: but he muſt not only be entred and enrolled there, but he muſt ſtudy and read, and do ſuch things as belong to a Scholar. When St. <hi>Peter</hi> bid the <hi>Jews,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Jailor to believe, and they ſhould be ſaved, they were ſuch as yet had not embrac'd Chriſtianity; and Faith was the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60245:111"/>only means to bring them to that, and ſo put them into a ſalvable ſtate, which ordinarily they cou'd not be in without it: but then they muſt do all thoſe other things which belong to Chriſtians after they are brought to believe, or elſe they wou'd loſe and forfeit this their good ſtate; and therefore when Chriſt ſpeaks to his Diſciples who already believ'd in him, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to thoſe who were already Chriſtians or Believers, they then tell them not only of Faith which is the firſt Chriſtian Vertue and the root of all the reſt, but of Obedience and all good works, of living as becometh the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and of adorning their profeſſion with all manner of Vertues, which they make as neceſſary to Salvation as Faith it ſelf. <hi>Thus if ye keep my Commandments</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ye ſhall abide in my love,</hi> John 15.10. and <hi>Ye are my Friends, if ye do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I command you,</hi> v. 14. and <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, Lord,</hi> or that meerly believeth in me, <hi>ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that does the will of my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 7.21. So ſaid St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians Circumciſion is nothing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, but the keeping the Commandments of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.19. and to the <hi>Galatians, in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> i. e. in the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60245:112"/>but a new Creature, chap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 15. that is, a new temper of mind and habit of Life, for by the Goſpel <hi>the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unrighteouſneſs of Men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Romans 1.19. and, <hi>when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, he will take Vengeance on all them that obey not his Goſpel, who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> 2. Theſſ. 1.8, 9. and thoſe Chriſtians who do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch works of the Fleſh as are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19, 21. ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God, but <hi>for the ſake of thoſe the Wrath of God cometh on the Children of diſobedience,</hi> Coloſ. 3.6. tho' they do believe in Chriſt and have made profeſſion of his Religion. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as requiſite for ſuch to live accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all the Laws of the Goſpel, as it was at firſt, to believe in Chriſt that they may be ſaved: What a Chriſtian there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who already believes in Chriſt and owns his Religion to be true, and what we who all do this, ſhould further do to be ſaved, and to make ſure of Heaven, I ſhall in one general Advice direct to, and that is this, That we never allow our ſelves to live in any one known ſin; that we never willfully violate any Law of
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60245:112"/>the Goſpel, nor ſuffer our ſelves in the Cuſtom of any thing that we know is unlawfull; he that does that is in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and deſperate condition, and is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being ſaved by the Terms of the Goſpel: for tho' that allows pardon for every ſin we repent of, yet it allows none to any one of thoſe we do not repent of, but live in; and therefore as we value our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; let no darling Sin, nor beloved Luſt, nor any the moſt profitable or pleaſing Wickedneſs whatſoever, be indulged or continued in by us; it's as much as our Souls are worth if we do, for every will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full habit of ſin does moſt certainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and ſhut us out of the Kingdom of Heaven, without timely Repentance and Amendment; if we have therefore been ever guilty of any ſuch, and ſo have forfeited Heaven and our own Souls, and made our ſelves liable to Eternal Wrath and Damnation; let us endeavour with all ſpeed to recover our ſelves out of that ſad ſtate, and to ſnatch our Souls out of the Jaws of Hell, and from the very brink of perdition; and let us bleſs God that he affords us both time and means and power to do this; and when we have Emerged out of that wretched Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let us not throw our ſelves into it again by any new Sins, but let us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after avoid that rock where we were
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60245:113"/>like to have ſplit; and let us ſpend all the remainder of our lives in perfecting our Repentance, and in bringing forth fruits worthy of it, and in a conſtant and unbroken, and uninterrupted obedience to all the Laws of Chriſtianity; ſo ſhall we approve our ſelves to God and our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences; ſo ſhall we have good grounds of Peace and Comfort while we live, and ſo ſhall we be certainly ſaved when we come to die; which God of his infinite mercy grant unto us.</p>

               <p>THE Fear of the Lord is a phraſe often uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to expreſs all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by, and 'tis indeed the true Principle and Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; for whoever has an awfull ſenſe and belief of a Being above him, and a juſt dread of his Almighty Power upon his Mind, will take care to avoid all thoſe things, that he knows are diſpleaſing to him, and to perform all thoſe duties which ſhall procure his favour, and be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60245:114"/>to him; for all our Happineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon his Pleaſure, and he can make us miſerable when we anger and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him.</p>
               <p>Every one, tho' he may have loſt the ſenſe of love, either of God or Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the deſire of Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Happineſs, and may be ſunk into ſuch a ſtate as to have no great reliſh of thoſe things; yet may have the ſenſe of fear ſtrong upon him, and may be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected with what he thinks may deſtroy and ruin and make him miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and therefore fear is the ſtrongeſt and moſt powerfull paſſion, and the moſt deeply rooted in humane nature, for it ariſes from a Natural love of our ſelves and a care and deſire of our own ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and every Man has this in him, tho' he has no higher or nobler princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Vertue and Religion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis the Character of the moſt deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably wretched and wicked Creatures, <hi>that they have no fear of God before their Eyes,</hi> Pſ. 36.1.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the love of God, ſometimes the fear of God, ſometimes the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, the belief of God is made to expreſs the whole of Religion, and the ſum of our duty; becauſe where one of theſe is, there are all the reſt in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or other, and they cannot be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60245:114"/>or divided: for he that believes a God, and knows him to be as he is, a Being of infinite Power and of infinite Goodneſs, muſt fear him and love him too; his power makes him an object of fear, and keeps us from offending him; and his Goodneſs makes him an object of love; and ſo both thoſe do the ſame thing, and as different cauſes yet concur to the ſame effect; and all Vertue and Religion is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by them, and owes its being and original to them: for without reſpect to God there can be no ſuch thing as Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion, and where there is a true fear of him, there they will always be as neceſſarily conjoin'd as effects are to their cauſes, and therefore by an uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Metonymy the one is put for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this Vertue and Religion which is thus founded in the fear of God, is the greateſt and trueſt Wiſdom in the World; he is the Wiſeſt man who is the moſt Vertuous and Religious; and he is the greateſt Fool who lives Vitiouſly and Irreligiouſly, and without the fear of God; <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> or the firſt and chief Wiſdom, and the Foundation of all other; <hi>a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding have all they that do his Commands,</hi> i. e. they are the truly wiſe Men who live Vertuouſly and Religiouſly, and they Fools who live Vitiouſly and Wickedly;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60245:115"/>
                  <hi>Behold the fear of the Lord, that is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to depart from evil is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no greater blemiſh, contempt, or imputation upon any Man, than that he is a Fool, and that he acts as ſuch in whatever he does; for it ſuppoſes the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt decay and depravation of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the loſs of his Reaſon, and that he wants that which makes us to be Men, and is the proper perfection of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is Wiſdom and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It will therefore greatly recommend, and be for the honour of Religion, if that appears to be the greateſt and only Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and it will juſtly reproach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Vice and Wickedneſs, if that be made out to be nothing elſe but folly in the higheſt degree; which I ſhall therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour at this time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt then Religion propoſes and attains and ſecures the greateſt End, the chief Good and utmoſt Happineſs that we can deſire or are capable of; and this is the trueſt part of Wiſdom, whereas Vice has but low and mean Ends, ſuch as are below the excellency of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are ſo far from promoting our Happineſs, that they defeat and deſtroy it: all beings indeed aim at their own Happineſs, and have a blind and general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to compaſs and attain it; ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60245:115"/>is a principle lies at the root of our Beings, and we cannot chuſe open and bare-fac'd miſery; but Vice and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs takes down the poyſon that is a little Guilded over, and ſwallows the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hook that is baited with an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſure or profit, and Men are led away in the dark, and deluded with a ſhadow till they are brought into the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſery; Vice propoſes either bodily and ſenſual pleaſure, or worldly gain, or ſome ſuch preſent End and Deſign to be its greateſt Happineſs; but alas, it often loſes thoſe, and Vertue and Religion picks up what the other drops, and lets go; and ſecures thoſe by ends a thouſand times bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than Vice does, whilſt it looks yet further, and ſtill aims at greater ends, and a more true and compleat Happineſs than any of thoſe can yield to it; for what is the moſt guſtfull and luſcious ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of body to an unquiet and uneaſie and diſturbed Mind? Is not that worm of Conſcience, that gnaws it within, and is bred from the filth and putrefaction of its own ſins, a greater torment than all the pleaſures of ſenſe can make amends for? And what could a Man hope for if by his wickedneſs he could gain the whole world, which yet many have even loſt by it, if thereby he loſes his Soul, the peace and quiet of it here, and its Eternal felicity
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60245:116"/>hereafter? All the ends we can aim at, and all the objects we can wiſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, are very little and inconſiderable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Religion, and ſuch are all the things and enjoyments of this World; but Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has great and noble aims and deſigns, to make our Minds as well as our Bodies pleaſed and eaſie, and to give a pleaſure and ſatisfaction infinitely above the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bodily delights, which the Brutes are capable of as well as we; to perfect and improve and fit our Souls for the greateſt pleaſure and happineſs here, and for that which is endleſs and unſpeakable hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and to ſee this more particularly, let's conſider,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, that all Ends and Deſigns but thoſe of Religion, are conſined on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this World, whereas thoſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion reach beyond this to a never end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eternity; how little and ſhort and narrow are all the poor deſigns we can have here, when in the compaſs of a few years, they all ceaſe and periſh and come to an end; when but a ſmall time hence they ſhall be as uſeleſs and inſignificant as if we had never been, or ne'er had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them. Death, which we all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and which will certainly come in a little time, whether we expect it of no, puts a ſpeedy end and concluſion to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther projects and deſigns but thoſe of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60245:116"/>and Religion; it covers all worldly Pomp and Grandeur with a cloud of night and darkneſs, and draws a ſable mantle o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all it's gliſtering and ſhining vanity; its honours lie here buried in the duſt, it's riches take leave of it at the Grave, and all its bodily pleaſures are exchanged for ſtench and noy fomneſs, and its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtrength and beauty is turned into weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gaſtlineſs. This mortifying conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration ſhould, one would think, make this World, and every thing in it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contemptible, and all ends and deſigns but thoſe of Virtue and Religion, which teach beyond this World, to be very poor and little, and inconfiderable; for like a Dream, they are all quickly paſt and gone; and when we awake into another World, into a better and more ſubſtantial life, all theſe images and ſhadows and fancies of happineſs will then vaniſh and diſappear, and we ſhall be no more affected with them than with a laſt nights dream, or the paſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſlumber and imagination; but then Religion and Vertue will ſtand us in ſtead, then they, and a good Conſcience will ſtick by us, and attend and bear us Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany into the other World; and there we ſhall meet with thoſe Ends and Deſigns which Religion has propoſed to us, and our greateſt hopes and wiſhes ſhall be turned into greater fruition and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60245:117"/>then a long Eternity ſhall reward and recompenſe our ſhort Labours here, and we ſhall never loſe or be depriv'd of that great End and compleat Happineſs which Religion recommended and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to. Vice with all its delights is but for a very little time, and the pleaſures of ſin are enjoy'd but for a Seaſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. Men not only loſe thoſe, and be for ever depriv'd of the End it aimed at, but ſhall receive its ſad and miſerable portion laid up for it, and be eternally tormented with unexpreſſible miſery; And what extream Folly will it then be found to have purſued no other End, nor aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at no other Happineſs but that of this World, which is ſo ſoon gone and at an end, and for the ſake of that to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it ſelf to a miſery that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have end; to have preferr'd a preſent moment before an endleſs Eternity, and to gain ſome poor and little Ends here, which yet are often loſt rather than at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by Mens Vices, to loſe Heaven and everlaſting Happineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Religion and Virtue ſecure the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Happineſs of this life as well as of another, much better than Vice and Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion; ſo that here is the extream fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Wickedneſs, that whilſt its doſigns are confined to this World and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60245:118"/>and bring Poverty and Beggery very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten along with them, ſo that the ruined Fortunes of moſt Men are owing to their vitious and ill Courſes, and they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by their Vices here, as well as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; an indelible Character of ſhame and reproach is hereby fixed to their Name and Memory, which ſtains and blemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es their Repute and Credit among Men, and their mind reproaches and ſmites them from within, and they feel moſt of the outward and inward evils which are the moſt grievous and uneaſie to us in this life. So that beſides the miſery in Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is due to them and unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, there is a preſent one which they ſeldom eſcape, but generally befalls them; ſo fooliſh are they whoſe fondneſs to their Sins makes them hug and embrace them, though they at the ſame time Wound and Poyſon them; ſo infatuated are they, and almoſt faſcinated by them, that they ſtick to them, though to their manifeſt ruin and againſt their plaineſt intereſt; and make themſelves ſuch Martyrs and Confeſſors to their Vices, that as they wear their ſcars always about them, ſo they will endure any thing for their ſakes, and make their way to Hell, through the greateſt ſufferings and evils that their ſins bring upon them here.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:60245:118"/>
               <p n="4">4. Roligion is the trueſt Wiſdom, as it beſt provides againſt all the Accidents and Contingencies of this uncertain world and againſt all the infirmities of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate and nature. A good man may not be ſecure here that he ſhall not come into the ſame misfortune, and be plagued like other Men, either with ſome Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Sickneſs, or other common Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which the greateſt Vertue and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion may be no protection againſt; but the ſame chance may happen both to the Sinner and to the Righteous, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect either to their Vice or to their Virtue: a Diſeaſe or a Misfortune, a Loſs or a Trouble may come upon either of them, which nothing can keep off or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, in this uncertain ſtate; but here Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion gives us the beſt relief, and ſtands us in the greateſt ſtead, and is the moſt uſefull to us; it takes care, as we may ſay, of the main chance, and makes the beſt proviſion for whatever may or can befall us; it ſupports and revives our drooping Spirits, under any afflictions of this world with the cheering thoughts of a Heaven above us, and a Providence over us, and the gladſom reflections of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence within us, and a Comfortable truſt in a good God without us; whereas when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the troubles and misfortunes of life fall on a wicked Man, he has nothing to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60245:119"/>keep up his mind under them, but they ſink and cruſh him into the utmoſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair and diſconſolateneſs, and he has no whither to fly for eaſe and comfort; ſad and miſerable muſt be his caſe, who, when his body is ſick and uneaſie, has his mind ſo too, and feels as much anguiſh and anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the one, as he does pain in the other; when his body is under the ſtrugglings and agonies of death, has his Mind and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence under greater; and when he ſees death come up behind him, ſees Hell open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, as ready to devour and ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him up. Tho' nothing can ſecure us againſt one of theſe, yet Religion does a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, which is ten times the greateſt; and ſo in all other the unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accidents and misfortunes of this worldly ſtate, Religion does wiſely prepare and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide againſt them, and make the beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and ſecurity for us againſt all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that may in this hazardous world come upon us; and without this a man lies always open to every uncertain accident, and ſhall be miſerable at every turn of Fortune, and ſhall have no Happineſs but what ſhall be at the will and pleaſure of outward Contingencies; and ſhall have no ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or root of Happineſs within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which nothing but Religion and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue can ever give him.</p>
               <pb n="197" facs="tcp:60245:119"/>
               <p n="5">5. Religion makes us wiſe for our ſelves and for things of the greateſt importance and concern to us; makes us wiſe unto Salvation, which is the only true Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that deſerves ſo to be called or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted: for 'tis a Wiſdom ſalſely ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and no other than great folly to be wiſe about all other things, wiſe in our Notions and Apprehenſions and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of things, wiſe in the Managery and Conduct of all our outward Affairs, wiſe in ſearching the policies and fatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the moſt cunning Intrigues, wiſe in the greateſt Myſteries of Knowledge and reſearches of Learning, ſo that both our ſelves and others applaud us for our great Wiſdom; and yet be a Fool, in what is more valuable and more concerning to us a thouſand times, which is the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation of our immortal Souls. He that is not ſo wiſe as to take care of that, is with all his other Wiſdom the worſt of Fools and Mad Men; and more void of common Prudence and Diſcretion, than he that while he pretends to underſtand the great ſecret of being Rich and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all into Gold, yet is Poor and a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; or like him in a Frenzy, who thought himſelf an Emperor, and to have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Territories and Dominions, when he had only a Chain and a little Straw; or him who while he was viewing the Stars
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60245:120"/>and obſerving the Heavens above him, did not mind his way, but fell into a Pit.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I ſhall ſhow the Wiſdom of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion from the two cauſes of ſin and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, which are only two ſorts of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and weakneſs of mind.</p>
               <p>The firſt is heedleſneſs, raſhneſs, and inconſideration; the other is infidelity and ignorance, or inapprehenſiveneſs of the truth of things. All Irreligion is owing to theſe two Cauſes; for either Men do not mind and conſider as they ought to do, thoſe principles of Religion, which they own and believe, as that there is a Heaven and a Hell, and an Eternal ſtate of Bliſs and Miſery after this Life, ſo as to let theſe have that full, force and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which they ought to have upon their minds; or elſe they do not really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and apprehend thoſe to be true: which are both high degrees of Folly and proceed from a great defect of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and want of Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt of theſe, what can be a groſſer folly than to act contrary to thoſe principles which we own and allow? to believe that there is a God, and that the Soul is immortal, and yet to live as if there were no God, and as if there were no other Life but this? This is certainly the moſt deſperate folly and madneſs to run upon the greateſt danger that we
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60245:120"/>ſee evidently before us, and to leap into Hell with our eyes open; when Men do real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe they ſhall be damn'd for a wicked and ill life, and yet ſtill continue in their ſins. 'Tis folly one would think, even to the height of diſtraction to live thus contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their belief and let their principles and their actions thus diſagree; and to condemn themſelves in their acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their own knowledge, belief and underſtanding, in a matter which is of ſo great moment and concern as they muſt acknowledge this to be. Of the two, the other, one would think, were more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable who do not believe theſe things, tho' that is great ignorance and folly; for 'tis diſ-believing that which all mankind have in all Ages believed in ſome degree or other, and which we have as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe as we can have, if the thing were never ſo true and certain; and which it is impoſſible we ſhould ever know, or have any reaſon to believe to be falſe; and which if it were only doubtfull and but meerly probable, or indeed poſſible, yet a wiſe Man would not run a great hazard or venture upon it, but would take care to ſave and ſecure himſelf againſt the worſt and utmoſt poſſibilities that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: I ſhall not now conſider the great weakneſs and folly of infidelity againſt the cleareſt reaſon and evidence, and the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60245:121"/>utmoſt demonſtration the thing is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, and requiring more than a thing of that nature can have; nor how Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is Wiſdom as being eſtabliſhed upon the greateſt foundations of truth and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. 'Tis the other folly that of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration by which moſt men periſh, by not attending to the power and force of thoſe truths, which they do believe; but raſhly and inconſiderately following the career of their Luſts and violence of their Inclinations, againſt the reaſon and belief of their Minds, and the conviction of their Judgment and Underſtanding; for could any Man that ſeriouſly conſider'd and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd an everlaſting ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, and let his mind duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and be affected with thoſe conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, which he really believes to be true; could he be wicked without the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt folly and madneſs? and can it appear to be any other than the moſt fooliſh and unreaſonable thing in the World to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all thoſe great and important things which Religion teaches us, and yet to live as if we believed none of them? This is ſuch unaccountable folly as wants a name, and can have nothing to palliate or excuſe it. Indeed a wicked life is the greateſt folly in the World, and appears to all to be ſo upon reflection and a little ſerious conſideration; no body but repents
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60245:121"/>of it afterwards, and is ſorry for it one time or other, tho' perhaps it be too late, and when he cannot retrieve or amend it, unleſs he be ſtupified and hardned and have loſt the uſe of his Judgment and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; which is a plain owning it to be Folly and Unadviſedneſs even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Tryal and Experience, and a wiſhing they had done better, and that they had been much wiſer.</p>
               <p>No Man Repents of his having done Vertuouſly and lived Religiouſly, but is pleaſed and ſatisfied in himſelf upon his reflecting upon it; which ſhows that he acted wiſely and prudently: but the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full agonies and ſad reflections, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and diſquiets that a Man feels in his mind upon his having liv'd wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhows the height of his folly, and how he is forc'd to condemn himſelf for it, and to bewail and lament his extream weakneſs and madneſs, and this is truly Hell; when he muſt do ſo to all Eternity, then I am ſure it will appear, whatever it does now, that Vice and Wickedneſs is the greateſt folly, and that Vertue and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are the true and only Wiſdom, and that what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays, is true; <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdom.</hi>

               <p>IT is a queſtion with ſome, whether Chriſt have added any thing to the law of nature, or requir'd any high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and more perfect Vertues than are founded in that. As for the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> he has taken away the Ritual and Ceremonial part of it; and as to the Moral, he has cleared it from the falſe gloſſes and corruptions and errors of the Scribes and Phariſees, who had expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it into a meaning contrary to the true ſenſe and intention of the Law: for that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60245:123"/>to be ſure coming from God cou'd have nothing immoral in it, and therefore what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever corrections were made by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour were only of the perverſe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt interpretations of others, and not of the Law it ſelf. But whether he has not added any new and more perfect Laws both to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and that of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and required higher inſtances of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of us Chriſtians, than of the reſt of mankind, is a great queſtion. On the one ſide it ſeems more for the honour of Chriſt and his Religion, in which there are ſome nobler precepts that excell any that are to be met with in any other Moraliſt; as againſt Luſt and Revenge, for loving Enemies, and not retaliating injuries, and the like. On the other ſide, if Chriſt has added any new Laws not founded in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they muſt be meerly poſitive and alterable, and not have any natural or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick good in them, but be owing to the mere Arbitrary will of God, and not to the original ſettlement and conſtitution of things; for if they have a foundation either in the nature of God, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, they cannot be new, and ſo added to thoſe of nature; but I think this Controverſie may be thus compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reſolved, that thoſe Laws, though they were founded in nature and had a natural and intrinſick and eternal Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60245:123"/>in them, as all moral Vertues have, yet cou'd not be ſo well known and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the dim-light of nature, nor were ſo fully promulged by the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as they are now by the Goſpel or the Chriſtian Revelation. One of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and nobleſt Virtues of Chriſtianity is that advice, precept, or duty given here in my Text, <hi>Be not overcome.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which, tho' there be no ſuch thing hardly to be found in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the quite contrary to be often met with in the beſt Heathen Moraliſts, who reckon'd Revenging an Injury as a part of Juſtice, and among the number of their Vertues; yet it's certain, if we conſider of it, it is very reaſonable, and has a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and intrinſick Goodneſs in it, and tends very much to the peace of our minds and the comfort of our lives among the many Evils, Injuries, and ill uſages from others we may probably meet with in this World; the beſt ſhelter and ſecurity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt which, and the beſt and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Vertue a Chriſtian ought to learn, is that of the Text; which tho' it be ſo much againſt the practice, and therefore ſeems to be againſt the nature of mankind, yet it is not; but is a moſt excellent duty in it ſelf and what we are always indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly bound to, both as wiſe Men and good Chriſtians: <hi>Be not overcome of evil
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60245:124"/>but overcome evil with good,</hi> from whence I ſhall firſt ſhow you what it is to <hi>be overcome of evil:</hi> Secondly, the good and excellency of not being overcome of evil, but overcoming evil with good; Firſt, what it is to be overcome of evil, <hi>i. e.</hi> the evil that is done to us by others, not that is done by our ſelves, for that overcomes us whenever we fall into it but we may ſuffer a great deal of evil or injuries from others, without being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by it; for it may be ſaid to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome us only by theſe ſeveral ways, 1. When it ſo takes away the peace of a Man's mind as to make him ſink un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: now no evil ought to do this, but the evil of ſin and guilt, and the ſad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of thoſe which are the wrath of God and Eternal Damnation; theſe are ſo dreadfull that nothing can bear or ſtand up againſt them, and therefore they are not to be born but to be avoided, and wr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ought to take care to eſcape them by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and a good Life, for there is no maſtering and overcoming them; they are ſo great and intolerable that humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot grapple with them or endure them with any degree of courage or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. But now all the evils of this World may be bravely withſtood or overcome, and we can rally up power and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſufficient to contend with them and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60245:124"/>hold out pretty tolerably againſt them, ſo as to preſerve an inward eaſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, peace and tranquility of mind under all, or any of them; and that ſtrength and vigour, and firmneſs, and conſtancy of a Man's mind, may not be broke or diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by them: and this is true Courage and Bravery, and Greatneſs of mind, which was moſt eminently in the firſt Martyrs and Chriſtians under all their ſufferings, wherein they were <hi>more than Conquerors thro' Chriſt, who ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, Rom.</hi> 8.37. And many others have bore Sickneſſes and Adverſity, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Calumny, and other misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of this World with great evenneſs and Equanimity and cheerfullneſs of mind, and have not been ſunk or depreſſed by them; they have not lain down under the burden, but tho' it has been heavy and hard, and they have felt it ſo, and not been without the ſenſe of it, yet they have born up under it, and with putting forth their ſtrength and patience, made it leſs than it otherwiſe would have been, or if they had faln down under it. Ill uſage and Injuſtice from others are not the leaſt of evils, nor the eaſieſt to be born; but when we conſider they are no more in our power to prevent than Diſeaſes or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Accidents that may befall us, the peace of our mind ſhou'd not be much
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60245:125"/>affected with them; ſince that ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to depend upon what is in our own power, and upon our own voluntary choice and actions, or elſe we can never have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſecurity of it, but it will be at the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy wholly of every chance or accident without us. And ſecondly, the way not to be overcome by them, is, not to dwell too much upon them in our thoughts, not to chew or ruminate upon them, nor keep them in our thoughts too moroſely, for that is to roll the bitterneſs of them, as it were up and down in our mouths and to taſte them over again; whereas to ſpit them out, to paſs them by, to neglect them, and not think of them, is the ſpeedieſt way to have done with them: if they lie heating and boyling upon our ſtomachs and the Cholerick and Revengefull hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour be fermented and put in agitation by them, it will greatly trouble and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy us; but when we check and ſuppreſs it at firſt, we are at eaſe preſently, and have none of thoſe tumultuous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly diſturbances that are in the breaſts of Revengefull and Malitious Men, that can never forget or paſs by an injury, but let it like a thorn in the fleſh alway pain them, and go in further and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and cauſe an Ulcer that ſhall throb and burn within, and be very troubleſome; whereas all might have been cured by
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60245:125"/>plucking it out preſently and throwing it away, and not letting it ſtick long or enter deep into our thoughts. 3. Not to have any thoughts of Revenging it is the beſt way to overcome it; for this leſſens the trouble of it, and puts a quick and ſpeedy end to it, whereas the other puts a Man upon a thouſand uneaſie thoughts and contrivances, ſets his head upon work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like the Devil how to do miſchief, and like him is all the while tormented with his own miſchievous deſigns, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they ſucceed or not; and is always reſtleſs and uneaſie leaſt they ſhould ſail and he ſhould be diſappointed: and if he is not, yet he procures no manner of good to himſelf, but only miſchief to another, which is all the Diabolical pleaſure of the moſt ſucceſsfull Revenge: and he is certainly overcome by an injury who is thus provoked to return and retaliate it, and will give himſelf a vaſt deal of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for no manner of good, but meerly to do ill to another; much good may do theſe Men with the ſweets of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, as they call it; the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be pleaſed and delighted in the midſt of Hell if there be great and true pleaſure in this. 4. We are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by evil when we are brought to commit the ſame evil, and do the ſame thing to others which they did to us; when
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60245:126"/>we are brought to render railing for rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, curſing for curſing, evil ſpeaking for evil ſpeaking, and the like; <hi>i. e.</hi> when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers treat us in this rude manner, and we return them the ſame again, and give them, as we ſay, as good as they bring. Mens Tongues are the moſt ready Inſtruments of their malice, by which they who are otherwiſe never ſo weak and impotent, and like a Serpent, crawling upon their bellies, as malice often does, yet can dart out their ſtings, even bitter words, and with their forked and poiſoned Tongues ſpit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of their venom at others which is in themſelves; and ſo plentifully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorge that filthy and corrupted matter of their own exulcerated minds. They conſider not that for all theſe evil and idle words (for it was chiefly of thoſe words of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny and Slander our Saviour ſpoke) they muſt give account in the day of Judgment, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. and that they are as anſwerable for ſuch words, tho they paſs away as the wind, as they ſay, as for the more laſting actions; <hi>For by thy words thou ſhalt be juſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned,</hi> v. 37. A Man may be damn'd as well for injurious words as injurious actions and they may often do as much miſchief not only to the perſon himſelf, whoſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit may probably be as dear to him as life, and as great an injuſtice to take it
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60245:126"/>away: And it may do a much greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to Religion, and hinder all the good, or a great part of it, which a Man might be otherwiſe capable of doing: And all this they are anſwerable for, who are the cauſes of it, and not the Innocent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is thus uſed. When the <hi>Jews</hi> ſlandered our Saviour, as <hi>a wine bibber</hi> and a drunkard, as <hi>a friend of publicans and ſinners,</hi> as <hi>a deceiver</hi> and impoſtor, and ſo kept others from hearing his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and receiving his Doctrine, they were anſwerable not only for themſelves but for the Souls of others, who thus pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by their means; and our Saviour was no way blamable for not doing that good which others hindred, and which he, tho' unſucceſsfully, yet heartily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd. 5. We are overcome by evil when we are brought by it to neglect any neceſſary duty, or to do any unfit and unlawfull act that otherwiſe we ſhould not have done; as they who will neglect Prayer, or coming to Church, or attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon God's word, becauſe they are offended with ſome of their Brethren who come there, or with their Miniſter, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they will fall out it ſeems with God himſelf too: they who will give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Charity, becauſe they who col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or diſtribute it, agree not with them in all things; and ſo they will revenge
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60245:127"/>the ſuppoſed injury of another upon thoſe poor wretches who never cou'd be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to do or think them any at all<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> they who will ſhow ſpite to the publick, and oppoſe the Government, becauſe ſome are in it they do not like or care for; and ſo their hatred to them ſhall make them do all the miſchief they can to the whole, and they will Sacrifice the Peace of the Kingdom to the private piques and animoſities with ſome particular Men. If the little injuries of others drive us to this, we are ſadly overcome by them; they overcome thoſe greater indiſpenſible obligations we ſtand in, which nothing can or ought to reſcind; and they make us do that which otherwiſe the ſenſe of our duty and conviction of our mind wou'd perſwade us not to do, if we were not thus blinded with paſſion and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with rage and anger, and had our underſtanding darkned and clouded with thoſe ſtorms of paſſion and reſentment, which ariſe in us. The beſt way to allay thoſe is to check them at firſt, and put out the firſt ſparks of the glowing flame, and not ſuffer it to kindle to any height in our breaſts, but to quench and ſtifle it immediately with wiſe thoughts and ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reſolutions, and with a deſigned neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and paſſing by of the ſuppoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury; if we would leſſen that or wholly
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60245:127"/>take it away and deſtroy it, if we would overcome the evil of it, the beſt way is by doing good for evil, by returning Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of kindneſs for thoſe of ill will, of Love for thoſe of Hatred, Friendſhip and Civility for Rudeneſs and Unmannerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Bleſſing for Curſing, ſpeaking well of others for their ſpeaking evil of us, and <hi>not rendring railing for railing,</hi> nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury for injury, <hi>but overcoming evil with good:</hi> How excellent a Virtue this is, what advantages and benefits belong to it, I come now to ſhow; nay how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a Chriſtian duty it is, without the performance of which, in ſuch meaſures as are required of us, we forfeit Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Pardon of our ſins at the hands of God. For no particular Vertue is made ſo much, and ſo expreſly the condition of our Pardon in the Holy Scripture as this; but how hard is it to perſwade our ſelves or others to it, for want of getting a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over the firſt riſings of paſſion, and being able to check the Brutiſh inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that belong to us with thought and reaſon; and for want of conſidering the excellency and perfection, nay, the eaſe and pleaſure of it, and the many obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have to perform it. As Firſt, It muſt be owned that the quiet of our lives, and the peace of our minds very much depend upon it; for it cannot but
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60245:128"/>be ſuppoſed that we ſhall ſometimes meet with very ill uſage and treatment from other people; the beſt of men have not been free from it, tho' they no way deſerved it; as our Saviour, one of whoſe ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings it is accounted, that he <hi>endur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the contradiction of ſinners againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> Hebrews 12.3. and the Apoſtles, who often complain of unreaſonable and perverſe and wicked Men, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2. and the greateſt examples of Virtue before and ſince them, ſuch as <hi>Socrates, Cato, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> and the like, have had the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and it's often the Lot and Portion of the beſt of Men, and that which has made them ſo as much as any thing; and God has ſuffered it for a Tryal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of their Virtue. Now if a Man muſt be always uneaſie and unhappy, and have a great diſturbance and diſquiet in his mind, when he meets with this, it will not be in the power of God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor of Vertue and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to make a man happy, as it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is, and to give him eaſe and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in himſelf, however others ſhall uſe and wrong him; if every rude and ill natur'd Perſon, whoſe Tongues are their own, and who will uſe them as they pleaſe without any regard to Truth, Manners, or Religion, ſhall task away a Mans peace and quiet; or their unjuſt and undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60245:128"/>uſage ſhall make a breach upon the ſteadineſs and firmneſs of a Man's mind, and he ſhall be diſturbed and unhappy, becauſe others are uncivil, humourſome and ignorant; there will be no ſuch thing as inward peace and quiet, nor will our Saviour's words ſignifie any thing, <hi>My peace I leave with you,</hi> John 14.27. <hi>In pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience poſſeſs ye your Souls,</hi> Luke 21.19. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are ye when men ſhall ſpeak evil of you and hate and reproach you,</hi> Luke 6.22. But a Man muſt mind which way the wind ſits or the Weather-cock turns, on which ſide the Birds fly, or which is as uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, what is the opinion of unthinking Men to judge of himſelf by. Indeed the opinion of good and wiſe Men who are able to judge, is very much to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is truly credit, which is to be preſerved next to Conſcience; but he that is not above the little noiſe and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant cenſures, and the brutiſh Clamours, and the petty injuries of others is a very weak, and will be often a very unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Man. 2. It's one of the greateſt and moſt pleaſant Virtues to gain a Victory over our own paſſions, and to overcome the brutiſh inclinations of Anger and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, which are apt to riſe in us at firſt upon the ſenſe of an injury. He that can calm and quiet thoſe, and by wiſe thoughts ſubdue the boyſterous rage and furiouſneſs
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60245:129"/>of an angry ſpirit, is a greater Man and a greater Conqueror than he that Conquers whole Countries and Cities, and fenced Places, and overcomes many thouſands of Enemies by the Sword, as the Wiſe man obſerves, <hi>He that is ſlow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, than he that taketh a City,</hi> Prov. 16.32. This is the true Virtue of a Man that maſters the beaſt, the brutiſh Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and Inclinations that are in him; which if he let looſe, they will rage and tear and devour him, and hurry him to revenge and madneſs, and all the diſmal effects of them. Nothing is ſo raſh and inconſiderate, and ſhows ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency and weakneſs of mind as thoſe paſſions which are apt to riſe up in us; and nothing ſhows greater Wiſdom and more true greatneſs of mind, than to Command and Conquer them, and bear a provocation and forgive it, inſtead of being ſet on fire, and overcome by it; nor can any thing be more pleaſant than to gain this Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our paſſions, for they are very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and uneaſie, and all find them ſo who are under them: but it's the greateſt eaſe and pleaſure of mind and body too, to be free from them, and to be in a calm, and gentle, and meek, and undiſturbed ſtate. Anger and revenge are the moſt uneaſie, and vexatious, and tormenting paſſions that
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60245:129"/>belong to human nature, that fire and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the ſpirits, put the blood into an Unnatural and Venemous Ferment, and the whole Man under the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the greateſt uneaſineſs; ſo that his mind can enjoy nothing, but is reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and tumultuous, and under a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fearfull and vexatious thoughts how to contrive and how to accompliſh it's Miſchievous and Revengfull deſigns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others. But to lay all theſe aſide, and to paſs by, and forgive an injury, and let our paſſions be quiet without any great reſentment of it, is to be at eaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our ſelves, and has more ſweetneſs and comfort in it than all the revenge in the World. 3. As this is overcoming our ſelves, ſo it's overcoming our Enemies too, and the beſt and the leaſt trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and the moſt generous way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering them; for firſt it diſappoints all their malice and avoids the blow they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to give us, for this puts by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury which was thruſt at us; or at leaſt takes off the ſmart, and the ſenſe of it, which is the greateſt evil that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by it, and they have loſt their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign if they ſee us not concerned at it. But further, if we can bring our ſelves to return kindneſs for injury, and <hi>overcome evil with good,</hi> this, if any thing, will overcome an Enemy, by making him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60245:130"/>a Friend, which is the greateſt and perfecteſt Victory in the World; and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due him with ſuch powerfull force and conduct that he cannot but yield to it. <hi>A ſoft anſwer will turn away his wrath,</hi> as the wiſe man ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.1. and ſhowing the kind offices of love and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and civility to him, will not only heap coals of fire upon his head, if he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to injure us, but in all probability melt him into kindneſs and goodneſs; for he muſt be a very barbarous wretch, and void of all ſenſe of humanity, beyond the rate of moſt Men, who will not be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by a generous kindneſs from an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy; and he muſt be a mere Savage, who is not to be wrought upon by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and good will. Revenging an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury is the way to double and encreaſe it and to keep up the War and Hoſtility, with vaſt trouble and expence; but the other preſently procures a Fair and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and an Honourable Peace and Reconciliation. Many think it will draw more injuries upon them if they do not revenge themſelves for thoſe paſt, and make it coſt others dear to hurt them, ſo that it's their Motto, <hi>nemo me impune laceſſet:</hi> but this for the moſt part fails, and is the worſt and longeſt, and moſt troubleſome way to get rid of them; every Man may indeed preſerve his right
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60245:130"/>if it be valuable and not better to part with it than to loſe it, and yet keep up fully to this temper of doing any good in his power, to thoſe who would do this evil to him: but to return evil for evil, injury for injury is no more the beſt way to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it, than it's to heal a wound by cutting it deeper and lancing it wider, when otherwiſe it would quickly cloſe of it ſelf; and love would be like oyl poured in to ſupple and heal it. 4. The overcoming evil with good is ſo like to God, who does good every day to us and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, tho' we injure and provoke him; that our having ſuch uſage from him, ſhould teach and learn us it, and incline us to practiſe it to our Brethren. If God ſhould be preſently enraged and reſolve to revenge himſelf upon us for every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury we offer to Heaven, <hi>i. e.</hi> for every ſin we commit, how ſad and lamentable a caſe muſt we be in; we therefore that live by virtue of this good principle, that owe our lives, and all the mercies we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy to this virtue in God, whereby he ſpares us, tho' we provoke him; and is ſlow to anger tho' we ſin againſt him, and revenges not himſelf upon us weak and impotent, and yet bold and daring Enemies: How ſhould we feel the good of it to our ſelves and not practiſe it to others? Did not God deal otherwiſe with
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:60245:131"/>us, than revenge and anger inclines us to deal with others, how might he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume us every moment; and never wait to be gracious, nor let his goodneſs lead us to repentance, nor never let us enjoy the bleſſings of his common providence, but ſhut up the Heavens that they ſhould not rain, and put out the Sun that it ſhould not ſhine upon ſuch evil and unjuſt, ſuch ſinfull and rebellious Creatures as we are? Nay, had he not been diſpoſed to this Vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which is the very perfection and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of the Divine Nature, he had not ſhown ſo much love and done ſo much good for ſinners, as to ſend his own Son Chriſt into the World to die for us, even when we were Enemies to him, and to God that made us. We then that had periſhed for ever had it not been for this Vertue, how ſhould we love and value it and endeavour to imitate it, and deal with our Brethren as God dealt with us! What an example of this our Savl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our has left, appears by his whole life, which was a perpetual ſuffering of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries and doing of good; and eſpecially at his death, when he pray'd for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and <hi>being reviled he reviled not again,</hi> but <hi>as a ſheep led to the ſlaughter he was dumb, and opened not his mouth,</hi> unleſs to pray for thoſe who barbarouſly uſed and murdered him: and in this he
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60245:131"/>left us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps. But Fifthly and Laſtly, This is not a mere Chriſtian perfection and a Noble Heroical degree of Virtue, which it's matter of advice to attain; but it's a neceſſary Chriſtian duty, without which we ſhall not go to Heaven, nor be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Pardon and Salvation at the hands of God. If we revenge the injuries that are done to us, God will not forgive us the ſins we commit againſt him: he has expreſly told us ſo, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.15. <hi>Mark</hi> 11.26. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.37. and that <hi>with the ſame meaſure we mete to others it ſhall be meaſured to us again,</hi> even by God in another World, who will ſhow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf mercifull to thoſe that are mercifull and froward to thoſe who are froward; and to thoſe who are revengefull and inexorable to their Brethren, he will be ſo too, when they ſtand in more need of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and forgiveneſs than any of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren can at any time do of them. What are the degrees and meaſures of exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this Virtue, I cannot now exactly ſhow you; but in general, to forgive an injury and not return it by another, to overcome it, not with evil but with good, is ſo much a duty to every Chriſtian, that he ſhall not come to Heaven who does not in ſome meaſure perform it, and who notoriouſly and plainly acts contrary to it.
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:60245:132"/>Let us therefore, for the preſent Peace of our Lives, for the quiet of our Minds and for the everlaſting Peace and Happineſs of our Souls, endeavour to learn this Virtue, and <hi>not be overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi>

               <p>AMongſt all the many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that there are for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and to perſwade men to a good life, there are none ſo ſtrong and ſo forcible if well conſider'd, as thoſe which are drawn from another World, and from a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments: There are indeed a great many that lie near and ariſe from ſeveral other conſiderations,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:60245:133"/>from the tendency of Religion to make us happy in this World; from the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable effects that moſt Vices have upon Men's Fortunes and Enjoyments; from the natural and intrinſick Goodneſs and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miableneſs, that is in Virtue and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, whereby it recommends it ſelf to our minds, and the abominable filthineſs and uglineſs that is in Vice, and it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to right reaſon as well as our true intereſt: by theſe and many other conſiderations Religion is ſtrengthened on every ſide and planted round with ſuch Arguments as are enough to defend it from moſt of the aſſaults that Vice and Wickedneſs can make upon it. But its ſtrongeſt Hold, its main Fort wherein lies its greateſt and impregnable ſtrength, is the thoughts of another World, of a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and a Hell hereafter; this will hold out if all the other ſhould fail, and if Vice ſhould be never ſo Fortunate and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as it ſometimes is in this World; if Wickedneſs ſhould have as many Prizes as Virtue in this Lottery of things that is here below: yet there it would be ſure to be the loſer, and could have no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to vye and contend with Religion; there the account between 'em appears manifeſtly and notoriouſly different, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adjuſting it by particulars, and making ſuch abatements as we muſt often in this
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:60245:133"/>World. This is a plain and obvious, an univerſal and undoubted, and one would think, an irreſiſtible Argument for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that depends not upon long rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings and many obſervations, as ſome others do, but may be eaſily underſtood, and will ſtrongly work upon all mankind; and therefore the Scripture does chiefly make uſe of it, and every where preſſes and ſuggeſts it to us, as the ſtrongeſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Divine Law, and that which is the likelieſt to prevail upon us, when 'tis fully believed and conſidered. The Rich Man here in the Parable, thought there was ſo much ſtrength in it, now that he ſelt it, that he queſtion'd not, but it would prevail even upon his wicked Brethren, if it were offered with all its advantage to 'em; if one went from the dead and told 'em what he ſuffered, and what they would certainly do, if they took not care in time, not to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that place of torment: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſeems to have picht upon the likelieſt way for this, when he requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Abraham,</hi> that a Meſſenger might be ſent from the dead to 'em; if that might be granted by the Laws and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the other World, there was no doubt ſure but it would attain the effect and bring 'em to Repentance; ſuch a Meſſage as he would ſend 'em, ſuch an
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:60245:134"/>account of things in the other World as he would give them, ſhould ſurely work ſtrangely upon 'em, and make 'em amend their lives. This he made no queſtion of, for had it been his own caſe, were he to have lived again, after he knew ſo much as he did now, he would have been quite another man, and ſo ſhould his Brethren one would think by ſuch a way as this was; but <hi>Abraham</hi> tells him the quite contrary, <hi>If they hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, tho' one riſe from the dead.</hi> This ſeems very ſtrange, and will do much more ſo, when we conſider particularly what Arguments a Meſſenger from the dead would bring along with him, to perſwade a man to Repentarce; ſuch as it is impoſſible ſure not to be overcome by them; ſuch as if they will not do, nothing elſe will: I ſhall offer ſome of them to you, and then endeavour to give you an account of what <hi>Abraham</hi> here ſays, <hi>If they hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither will they be perſwaded tho' one roſe from the dead.</hi> And,</p>
               <p>Firſt, let us conſider what ſtrong and powerfull Arguments a Meſſenger from the dead would bring along with him to perſwade a wicked man to Repentance; and in the</p>

Firſt place, he would ſatisfie him of the truth and certainty of ſuch a place; that there is really a future ſtate; that there is not an end of us when we go off from this Worldly Stage and Theatre, but that there is another life to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed this, wherein we ſhall receive as we have behaved our ſelves here. That the Soul when it is releas'd from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and puts on a thinner and a lighter Vehicle, paſſes to the vaſt Regions of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and there has a very different life from what it had here; when naked of all earthy matter, and not wanting any of the Conveniencies of its mortal ſtate, its thoughts are more vigorous and ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and it underſtands more clearly and wills more freely, and acts more nimbly and expeditely and unreſtrainedly. He could tell us how it feels it ſelf, when it is firſt looſed from the Body, and ſtrip'd naked of its fleſhly Cloathing; whither it will betake it ſelf next, and to what place it is convey'd; what reception it has at its firſt coming into the other World, and how it is provided for, when like a ſtranger it arrives at that unknown place. He would acquaint us how it was brought before the bar of God, and a Divine Judgment immediately paſs'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and ſo was Sentenc'd to its ſinal ſtate and irreverſible doom, according to
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60245:135"/>what it had done in the fleſh whether it were good or evil; and therefore in the</p>
               <p n="2">2. Second place he would acquaint us with the Happy and Bleſſed ſtate of good Souls there: If he were <hi>Lazarus</hi> as was deſired here by the rich man, one that lay in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom, and taſted of the Joys and Pleaſures that are at God's right hand, what a raviſhing account would he give us of thoſe things, which <hi>no Eye</hi> upon Earth <hi>hath ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither hath it enter'd into the heart of any Man</hi> who hath not enjoy'd 'em to concieve what they are. He that had been an Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous City and Beautifull Palace of the great God; what a Deſcription would he give of all the Glories of it, of all the Riches and Heavenly Treaſures that are there laid up, of all the Crowns that are worn by every Citizen there, of all the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that are there for every Soul; of all that bleſt Society of Angels and gloriſied Spirits, of all the Orders of Cherubims and Seraphims, and all the Armies of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; of the Glorious Throne of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly King, and of the Lamb that ſits upon it; of the luſtre and brightneſs that ſhines in every place, and the Joy and Gladneſs that dances in every heart, and ſparkles in every eye, and appears in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60245:135"/>face; of the great Complacency and Delight that they have in one another, and the moſt inflamed Love and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, with which they meet their fellow Saints; how they are infinitely Happy in themſelves, and double all their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the ſweet reliſh and taſt they have of that of others as well as their own; how they live all in Raptures and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies of Joy, and have their Souls over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed with thoſe Rivers of Pleaſure that are at God's right hand, and for ever ſtream from that Spring and Fountain of all good. In a word, that they enjoy ſuch Pleaſures and Delights, that he which ſelt 'em one moment, would be willing to endure all the Racks and the Tortures of the crueleſt Perſecutors that he might but once taſt of 'em again: That thoſe ſhort afflictions are not worthy to be compared with them; that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Pleaſures and Delights in this World, are but ſaint and empty ſhadows and poor reſemblances of 'em; and that he long, to be enjoying 'em again, and that he is impatient to be ſo long abſent from 'em.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A Meſſenger from the dead would teſtiſie alſo of the Miſery and grievous Torments of Men wicked and ſinfull. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> that had ſeen the ſlames of Hell, tho' aſar off, or <hi>Dives</hi> that had felt and
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:60245:136"/>been in the midſt of them, would give a Tragical deſcription of that place of horrors; he would tell us what a Diſmal and Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate place is that dark Priſon, where they are ſhut up with helliſh Fiends and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirits, who affright and inſult over the wretched Soul; how they are there bound hand and foot with chains of darkneſs, not able to move any way for the leaſt eaſe, nor call to any Friend to pity or comfort 'em; how they are always ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a dark and bottomleſs Pit, and lie for ever ſcalding in a Furnace of fire, rowling and ſcorching in a Lake of burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Brunſtone; where the raging flames with unexpreſſible pain enter the tender parts, and pierce through the Soul with their keenneſs and ſharpneſs; how in the extremity of their Torments, the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretches cry out and roar, and <hi>gnaw their tongues for pain, and blaſpheme the God of Heaven becauſe of their pains,</hi> Revel. 16.10, 11. How with Rage and Fury againſt themſelves, curſing their own folly and madneſs, and ſwallow'd up with bitter deſpair, the remembrance of their own Guilt ſtings their enraged Conſcience, and the never dying Worm gnaws and eats at their very hearts; and the anger of an Almighty and Incens'd God lies always heavy upon 'em, and his wrath preſſes 'em fore, and fills their Souls with all the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60245:136"/>dreadfull Ideas of ſear and deſpondency: and in the midſt of all this anguiſh there is one thing more terrible than all this, than all they feel, and that is the Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, that it ſhall laſt for ever, that there ſhall be no end of thoſe Torments that they are not able to bear for one day; This, this is the bittereſt and moſt ſad circumſtance that confounds the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tormented Soul, and ſharpens eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pain it feels, and fills it with unexpreſſible Horror and Deſpair, that it muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure all this to inſinite Ages, to a bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and never ending Eternity; and that after it has lain many thouſand years in that place of Torments, it will ſtill have as many to go through as it had at firſt. Oh, ſad and dreadfull ſtate! how grievous and intolerable does it appear to us, and how would one that had been in it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it? How if he had but as much Charity as <hi>Dives,</hi> would he warn us not to come into that place of Torments? how unwilling would he be to go back to it, how loth to end his meſſage, and how deſirous to give us an Eternal account of them, rather than endure 'em?</p>
               <p>And now would a wicked Man be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt this meſſage? could he ſtand out againſt ſuch Arguments as theſe are? would not theſe cool the heat of his Luſts, and damp all the Jollity of his moſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60245:137"/>tempting Vices? Would not this ſpoil all their Charms and ſully all their enticing Peauty and Gayety? Would not ſuch a Ghoſtly Meſſenger appearing before him make his blood chill, and his joynts trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the heart of the moſt hardy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be afraid at the ſight of him, when he brought the terrible news to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in wickedneſs, from one with whom they had often laugh'd at Religion, and the ſtories of Hell, and another World; with whom they had been often merry and that with thoſe very things that they now hear the truth of, who thought them if not meer Bugbears and Fables, yet things a great way off and at a great diſtance, that they ſhould not much trouble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves withall; when now they find all theſe are true, and are put in mind of 'em by ſuch a way as this is, and they ſo nearly concern them, and are like in a little while to be their own Caſe? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by all theſe they will be perſwaded and brought to Repentance; I believe there is no ſinner but thinks he himſelf ſhould be perſwaded by theſe means, and if God ſhould uſe ſuch an extraordinary way to convert him, this he queſtions not, but would do it; tho' now he is of another mind, and has no thoughts of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſins, yet that he thinks would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly work upon him. He I doubt may
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60245:137"/>be as much miſtaken of himſelf, as <hi>Dives</hi> was of his Brethren, of whom <hi>Abraham,</hi> aſſures him, that <hi>if they heard not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, neither would they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, tho' one roſe from the dead.</hi> And that I may give you ſome account of the likelihood of this, and of the truth of what <hi>Abraham</hi> here ſays, I ſhall offer you theſe five conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the Arguments which a Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger from the dead would bring along with him, and which are indeed ſo ſtrong that when one ſeriouſly conſiders them, one would think it impoſſible to reſiſt them, theſe we have already, and they have been offered to us with their full ſtrength and advantage; we have been made acquainted with the immortality of our Souls, and a future ſtate, with the Joys of Heaven, and the torments of Hell, theſe can be no new diſcoveries to us, that we never heard of before.</p>
               <p>God in the Scripture had laid open the other World before us, and ſhown us the two vaſt and different parts of it; he had given a general notice of this to all Men by the light of Nature, by that they could diſcern that there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Country that lay off from this; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſtate after this life, wherein good men would be happy and wicked men miſerable. This was known to all the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60245:138"/>old unskillfull World, before ever there was any Revelation, any <hi>pixis nautica,</hi> or any ſuch Map or Chart, as we have now of the other World: they had not only a kind of gueſs or probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture of it, like <hi>Columbus</hi> of <hi>America,</hi> but ſomething more that made it a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Article of the Heathen Religion; but this is made plainer to us by the Scriptures and Goſpel Revelation, by which <hi>Life and Immortality is brought</hi> more clearly <hi>to light;</hi> ſo that all thoſe Arguments are ſet before us, and that with the ſame ſtrength and advantage that they could have been by a Meſſenger from the dead; He could bring us no more, nor any new ones, but only what we have already; God has informed us of what belongs to another World, ſo far as it is of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to us, and ſo much as is ſufficient to make us take care about it; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have better and fairer warning about thoſe things, and we can have no ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or more powerful Arguments than we have already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have ſo much reaſon to believe the truth of thoſe things, that they who will not be ſatisfied with that, neither would they be perſwaded tho' they had a particular Meſſenger to certifie 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them; we have a Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on added to natural light, and the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60245:138"/>ſuffrage of mankind; we have had a number of Miracles and extraordinary Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Divine power, to aſſure us of the truth of that Religion, that delivers us the belief of thoſe things: We have had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Prophets ſent from God, and with ſufficient Credentials to ſatisſie us that they were ſo, to Preach theſe things to us: We have had one come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and after he was dead, riſe again, and ſo become even a Meſſenger from the dead to us, and teſtiſi'd all theſe things to be true. And if we will be ſuch Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks as ſtill to entertain doubts and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe all theſe, we ſhould be the ſame I fear, tho' we had one come from the dead to us; we ſhould be apt to think it but a Spectre, a meer Image of Air or of Fancy, a Melancholy Mormo, or a waking Dream, and be inclined to think that we were impos'd upon by our own active Imaginations, and the many reports and ſtories we have heard of ſuch things running in our minds; he that can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe all the undoubted Arguments for the truth of Scripture, and reveal'd Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion may run ſo far into Scepticiſm, as to diſ-believe his ſenſes, and to think e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that appears to him to be fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick and imaginary.</p>
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:60245:139"/>
               <p n="3">3. If he did believe it at that time, and were never ſo much ſtartled and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſurprizing apparition, yet in a little time the ſenſe of it might wear off and he be never the better for it; it might put him into a ſit of horror and conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as the hand on the Wall did <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzer,</hi> Dan. 5.6. <hi>ſo that his Countenance ſhould change, and the joints of his loins be looſed and his knees ſmite one againſt another;</hi> but the ſright might work upon his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more than his Mind, and when that is over they might both return to their former and natural temper. Is it not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual for a great many, who by a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſit of lickneſs, are brought ſo near the other World, that they can almoſt ſee into it, and have at that time as firm a belief and as ſtrong a ſenſe of it, as if not only a Meſſenger from the dead came to them, but they were there themſelves; yet theſe when they riſe as it were from the dead, and return from the borders of another World, when they have recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their health and are come into their old Company, their former Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and courſe of Life, how do they loſe the ſenſe of what they had in their ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, tho' it were never ſo ſtrong, and become the ſame Men they were before. Like perſons in a ſhipwrack, when the next Wave is likely to be their Sepulchre,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60245:139"/>and they think themſelves every moment ſinking into the deep below; then they are greatly concerned, and make a great many Vows and Reſolutions, which at that time they queſtion not to keep: but when the ſtorm and the fright is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they forget all their good Intentions, and their Religious Temper goes off, and they return to their former Temper of Mind. It muſt be a calm and gentle, a ſedate and compoſed method that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally works upon a Man's mind, and brings by degrees new Thoughts and Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into it, rather than a ſudden and haſty fright, that only ſtartles and amazes it; and 'tis that is more agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a free and reaſonable Creature, which is to be dealt withal by ſuch a ſuitable and kindly procedure, rather than that which has nothing in it but force and violence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As God does ſeldom humour Men by doing any thing that is Miraculous or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, when they have ſufficient or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means, ſo if he would do it, it would hardly cure their perverſe obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and infidelity; God is not willing to gratifie the wantonneſs or infidelity of mankind, and proſtitute his Almighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to their Luſts and Follies by doing extraordinary things when there is no need of them: he will not work Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60245:140"/>as faſt and as often as the Atheiſt is pleas'd to call for 'em, when he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him other ſufficient demonſtrations of a Divine power; he will not ſend an Angel to Preach his Laws over all the Earth, or to ſpeak to men every day with a voice of Thunder, when he has other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſufficiently made known his will to them. Our Saviour would not come down from the Croſs to ſatisfie the Cavils and unreaſonable Requeſt of an unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Jew,</hi> when he had done ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Miracles before to convince him; he would not give ſuch a ſign as was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by an Evil and Adulterous Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.39. when they had other ſigns enough. As this would make his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power Cheap and Contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to let it be at the pleaſure and call of every unreaſonable and humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome perſon; ſo if he ſhould exert it never ſo often, it would not have that effect we imagine upon them: for he, who is ſo unreaſonable an Infidel and ſo obſtinately unſatisſied as to ſhut his Eyes againſt full Evidence and juſt Conviction, will never be wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all likelihood by any thing that ſhall be done farther; though Heaven ſhould be at a farther expence and tire it ſelf as it were to do Miracles without End or Number, yet it would be ſtill the ſame.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60245:140"/>Of this we have a very great inſtance in the Old Teſtament; <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who had ſo many Miracles wrought before him, and as many Plagues as Miracles to make him Obedient to one Command of God, when he ſaw the Rivers and all the Water in his Country, turn'd into Blood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.19. when all his Land was covered with Frogs, and they came into his preſence Chamber; when the duſt of the Earth was become Lice, and he could not but confeſs, that this was the ſinger of God; when a great many more Miracles, of which he could not but have a very great ſenſe, were done before his Eyes, yet ſtill his obſtinacy was too hard for 'em, and a Miracle beyond all the reſt. Indeed when he was under the preſent ſmart of a Judgment, it would awaken him for a moment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.28. but as ſoon as it was removed, and he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite, he was immediately hardned. And thus probably would an obſtinate and hardned ſinner, when a Meſſenger from the dead was talking with him, he would melt and ſoften, and cry out as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> did, <hi>I have ſinned, Exod.</hi> 9.27. and reſolve at that time to let his ſins go; but yet in a little time he would harden again and reſolve not to part with 'em. Of this there is an inſtance as great and ſtrange alſo in the New Teſtament, and that is not
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60245:141"/>in a ſingle Perſon, but in a whole Nation. The <hi>Jews</hi> in our Saviour's time tho they ſaw him do ſuch works as never man did, ſuch as out-did all that were recorded of any of their own Prophets; tho' they ſaw him raiſe the dead, and cure the ſick, and were Eye-Witneſſes of the daily Miracles he wrought amongſt them, yet all this would not cure 'em of their obſtinate Infidelity; nor could the Son of God uſe any reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for their perverſeneſs and wilfull incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity: which plainly ſhows that men may arrive at ſuch Stubbornneſs and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, that even Miracles and the moſt extraordinary means will not work upon them. Where there is not ſuch an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy of the Will, but only a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Ignorance cauſed by want of the ſame means that others have enjoyed; there thoſe extraordinary Miracles would have another effect, as if the works which our Saviour did in <hi>Galilee had been done in</hi> Tyre <hi>and</hi> Sidon, <hi>they had long ago repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſack-cloath and aſhes,</hi> as he tells 'em <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.21. and ſo if a Meſſenger had come from the dead to thoſe that had never heard of <hi>Moſes</hi> or the Prophets, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any Revelation or Means of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things another way, they would probably have been perſwaded by him; but when Men have once ſtood out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ordinary means that God has
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60245:141"/>afforded them, there extraordinary ones will ſeldom prevail upon them, if God ſhould think fit to make uſe of 'em; and that</p>
               <p n="5">5. As another reaſon why, if they heard not <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, neither would they be perſwaded tho' one roſe from the dead; becauſe the mind is ſo blinded by the love of its ſins, and the Will ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and corrupted by them, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a long cuſtom and habit continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in againſt all the ordinary means of Grace, and all the powerfull conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Religion, that it becomes utterly incurable. The love of Vice darkens a Mans mind, and blinds his reaſon and judgment, it bars up his Underſtanding againſt the plaineſt Truths, and makes him reſolve not to believe that to be true, which it is his intereſt ſhould be falſe; and from hence it is that a great many who would be glad that there were no Heaven or Hell hereafter, are brought to queſtion the truth of them, and pretend not to be ſatisfi'd with that Account and Evidence that the Scripture gives of them: and if they had more, and the ſame that they do now require, to ſee one from the dead; yet the love of wickedneſs would ſtill make 'em very unwilling to believe it, and their corrupted Wills would be too hard for their underſtandings; it
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60245:142"/>would be very hard to convince them that that was true, which they had ſo great an inclination and ſo great a deſire ſhould be falſe. And from hence it is, that Men's Infidelity ſprings in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not from want of ſufficient Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their underſtandings, but from a corruption, and pravity of their Wills, by which means their underſtanding has a cloud and a film drawn over it, ſo that it is quite darkned to the cleareſt and moſt evident light; they grow ſenſeleſs and ſtupified, and their intellectuals are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted, and their reaſon depraved and the whole mind ſunk into ſuch a miſerable ſtate and condition, that they are become ſuch of whom the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 12.40. <hi>He hath blinded their eyes and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their hearts, that they ſhould not ſee with their eyes, nor underſtand with their heart, and be converted ſo that God ſhould heal them,</hi> and that neither with all the ordinary nor the extraordinary methods which he can uſe towards them. Let us therefore take care not to fall into ſuch a ſad ſtate and condition, by indulging our ſelves in the love or the practice of any wilfull ſin; which may by degrees ſo ſtrangely hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and deceive us, ſo faſcinate and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch us, that when it has baffled and overcome all the ordinary remedies of the Divine Grace and Providence, it ſhall be
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60245:142"/>paſt all cure, and all poſſible recovery. We ſee how ſtrangely ſome Men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to their ſins, tho' they ſee the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſchiefs that will certainly follow from them, that if they ſhould ſee Hell it ſelf even open before them, yet it would hardly prevail upon them: but let us conſider the great arguments of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, contained in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Chriſt and the Apoſtles. God has given us a ſtanding Canon and Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Will, which we may be ſure contains all things in it that are neceſſary to perſwade all Men to Repentance and carry 'em to Heaven; and 'tis this is the moſt proper and moſt perfect method that God has thought fit to make uſe of to that purpoſe, and much better than ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meſſengers from the dead to do this, which would ſignifie nothing, unleſs they were ſent in every particular Age, and to every particular Perſon: and what that could do, this the Holy Scriptures may do now, if we conſider and attend to them. The Papiſts indeed ſeem to be ſomething of the rich Man's mind, that the Scriptures are not ſufficient, nor the beſt way to convert Men; and therefore they have taken away thoſe from the people, and inſtead of them, have put their fabulous Legends, their ſtories of Purgatory, and of Men coming from the dead into their
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60245:143"/>hands: but a well atteſted and conſirm'd Revelation has infinitely the advantage of all thoſe, and therefore by thoſe and by what is contained in them, let us be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded from a courſe of wickedneſs and impiety: Let thoſe powerfull conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of another World, which are there laid before us, prevail upon our hearts; and let us not hope if we neglect thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and ſufficient means, which God has appointed for that purpoſe, that we ſhall be made good, or converted by any miraculous or extraordinary methods of Divine Grace; for <hi>if we hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> and much more Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>neither ſhould we be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivaded tho' one roſe from the dead.</hi>

               <p>There have been diſputes about this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Learned men, but I intend not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider 'em or the particalar ſuperſtition of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> which conſiſted probably in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Ignorant forwardneſs of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping all manner of Daemons and Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they could hear of; and all the Heathen Polytheiſm was ſuch a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and aroſe from that ground: but I intend to diſcourſe to you of ſuperſtition in general, and that not of the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word and its Etymology, but of the thing it ſelf, and what is truly meant by it, what is the nature of it, and wherein it conſiſts. Superſtition is a word that has made a great noiſe in the world, and, like other words of ambiguous and uncertain meaning, it has been clapt upon whatever men pleaſed, and been made a phraſe to denote whatever they diſlike in a Religion, whether they have reaſon for it or no; it has ſtood for a mark of what is to be hated, tho' they cannot tell why; to beget
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60245:145"/>an averſion to a thing and a ſuſpicion of ſomething ill in it, tho' they cannot clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee or underſtand it. Indeed ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has been the great Diſcaſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it has like a Canker eat into the heart of it and conſumed it, it has put it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally into a great heat, but often into a Frenzy too, and grows ſometimes to a Religions diſtraction. 'Tis that by which the Devil when he cannot deſtroy the natural ſenſe of a God and Religion out of Mens minds, yet ſo darkens and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it, that it may be of no great uſe to them, nor do much to deſtroy his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or Kingdom in the World; it is too apt to grow up in weak, and not ſeldom in good and pious minds; it ſadly over-run all the Heathen World, and too ſoon crept into the Chriſtian Church; it ſticks like a ſecret Leproſie to many, even holy things, and the Prieſts themſelves do not diſcern it; and it is as common as any where among thoſe who are the loudeſt and fierceſt in exclaiming againſt it. But that we may underſtand what is the true nature of it, I ſhall endeavour to give you as clear an account of it as I can, in the following method.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By giving a general Definition or Deſcription of it, and explaining the parts of that.</p>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:60245:145"/>
               <p n="2">2. By conſidering ſome particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Superſtition, and examining o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are accounted ſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By enquiring into the true Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it, and the right means to avoid it.</p>
               <p n="1">I. By giving a general definition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now I would thus define ſuperſtition; 'Tis ſuch a miſtaken apprehenſion of God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as makes us worſhip him in an undue manner, and place Religion in thoſe things in which it does not really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. 'Tis an apprehenſion of God. The ſuperſtitious have a great ſenſe upon their minds of a powerfull being above 'em; that there is a God who is the inviſible Lord of the World. This is the common belief of the religious and the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. The Atheiſt, who thinks there is no ſuch Being, no ſpiritual and inviſible Powers above him, but that theſe are all the Spectres of fear and fancy, and the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Images of our own ſcared Thoughts and Imaginations, he calls all Religion Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and thinks it the beſt way to free Mens minds from the ſlaviſh fears of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above them, to deny either him or his Providence, and clear his mind if he can from all the thoughts of Religion, that ſo horribly oppreſs it and keep it in bondage.</p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:60245:146"/>
               <p>This is a mad and an extravagant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and what he was encourag'd to from the folly and wildneſs of ſuperſtition, and the miſchief that it had done in the World, and from laying all the <hi>ſceleroſa, atque im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia facta,</hi> all the Villanies which that had committed, to the charge of Religion. This is very diſ-ingenuous and unjuſt, and the other is a very falſe extravagance to expell the thoughts of a God, in order to the quiet and eaſe of our minds. There is no ſuch reaſon for fear and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly in the belief of a God, if we have true and right Conceptions of him; 'tis matter of the greateſt Comfort to us, to think there is an Almighty Being to take care of us, and to do us good; to keep the World orderly, and to govern all things below. We have all reaſon to rejoyce in our having ſuch a common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to provide for us, and ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor to protect us, who is wiſe and good as well as powerfull, which is the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a God: ſad would be our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion if there were not ſuch a being, and I know no ſuch melancholy conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as that which the Atheiſt ſuppoſes to be the remedy for all his fears and diſquietudes, the believing there is no God; for then we take away all true hope and comfortable truſt, and have nothing at all to ſupport our ſinking minds, nor to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:60245:146"/>relieve the neceſſities of mankind; ſo that tho' ſuperſtition believe a God, yet the belief does not make Men ſuperſtitious; but,</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis a wrong and miſtaken appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of this God, the believing him to be a ſevere and cruel Being, arm'd indeed with irreſiſtible power, but arbitrary and wilfull in the uſe of it, and that may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably do infinite miſchief, and only ruin and deſtroy his innocent Creatures with it; that may make them only to be the paſtime of his rage, and the ſport and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of his Almighty revenge, and may damn the greateſt part of 'em to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal flames, only to ſhow his Groatneſs and incontrolable Power over them: or if he be not thus Cruel and Tyrannical, yet that he is froward and pettiſh, hard to be pleaſed and eaſily provoked; that it is next to impoſſible to pleaſe him, and utterly ſo to be reconcil'd to him when be is angry: ſuch thoughts as theſe of God, may very well produce a ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and uncomfortable dread of him, and ſill the mind with nothing but ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and aſtoniſhment, and a diſmal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and perplexity; and in theſe black colours ſuperſtition always draws him with gaſtly look and terrible viſage; with a brow always threatning, and a hand Armed with Thunder, and ready
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60245:147"/>to ſtrike without any regard to the merit or behaviour of thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. And were God ſuch a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as this, without natural Juſtice or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Righteouſneſs, were not his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as infinite as his power, and were not one as much his nature as the other, then indeed we might live as miſerably under the thoughts of him, as the moſt timorous Slave does under his mercileſs Patron, or the pooreſt Priſoner under his inſolent Keeper; and what will not ſuch fearfull wretches do to appeaſe the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuch a God, as they think is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them? what is ſo mean and baſe, what ſo fooliſh and ſilly, what ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and barbarous, that they will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to ſatisfie this devouring <hi>Moloch?</hi> It is very ſtrange that ever Men ſhould think the burning their Children alive, ſhould be an acceptable duty in Religion; or that cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their own throats ſhould pleaſe their Gods; but when they have had ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full apprehenſions of them, no wonder that theſe cruel things were made the offices of their Religion, which were ſo ſuited to the conceptions of their Gods; For in the</p>
               <p n="3">3. Third place, theſe miſtaken appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of God, will put Men upon wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping him in an undue manner; the acts of worſhip and offices of Religion
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60245:147"/>will be ſuitable to the conceptions we have of the Divine nature, if we think God is a ſevere and a cruel being, we ſhall think he delights in nothing ſo much as in bloody Sacrifices, and in having his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars reek with Human gore, which was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a very general cuſtom, and a common office of the Gentile Religion; and the Devil, without doubt, endeavoured to bring mankind into this abominable ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, by repreſenting God to be ſuch an one as himſelf, and by making his own Diabolical temper, to be the Image and Character of the Divine nature, by thus ſetting up himſelf as the Idol of God; this horrid worſhip did terminate in him, and what <hi>the Gentiles thus offered they Sacrificed to Devils and not to God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.20. But if we have other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of God very unſuitable to his nature, if we think he is not a wiſe and righteous, but a vain being, that will be pleaſed with little and outward things, with affected Formalities and ſtudied Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments, with officious Addreſſes and appearing ſhows, with adorning Images and pompous Proceſſions; then all our Religion quickly runs into thoſe trifling things, and to be ſure, it will ſome way be defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, if it have not a very right Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, a true conception of God and his Nature.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:60245:148"/>
               <p n="4">4. This will neceſſarily bring Men to wrong apprehenſions of Religion, and to place it in thoſe things in which it does not conſiſt; it will make them think God is pleaſed with what is no way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his nature, or elſe diſpleaſed with what is no way contrary to it: God's Love or Hatred to any thing, is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Nature, and if we miſtake in that, we ſhall do ſo in his Will too, which is always Regulated and Conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the eſſential rectitude and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his Nature; and this, as 'tis the trueſt Original, ſo 'tis the beſt Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of the Will of God: but ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that knows not God aright, as it is afraid of him, as of a Friend in the dark, ſo in other things it fears where no fear is; and yet thinks to oblige by ſuch pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull things as would hardly pleaſe a wiſe Man, and much leſs a wiſe God; it will keep off from ſome very innocent things, as if all the bane of the ſeven dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſins were in them, and yet will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down many a Camel, whilſt it ſtrains ſo hard at a ſingle Gnat; it will be as punctual and zealous in ſome little per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances as if they were the ſum and ſubſtance of Chriſtianity, tho' they are perhaps hardly the ſhell and outſide of it: and what is the main and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial part of it, that it ſhall think of
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60245:148"/>little worth, in Compariſon to the other; it ſhall fall ſhort of the plain and moral duties of Religion, and over-do it in the poſitive ones to make amends or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute for the other; it ſhall ſeem in ſome things to be an exceſs of Religion, as ſome have defined ſuperſtition; but 'tis but as the Rickets is an exceſs of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment in ſome parts that want it not, whilſt the others do conſume and pine away; 'tis really the defect of Religion. It ſhall ſeem to court God and flatter him, but not love him; for ſuperſtition is often a ſort of religious flattery that make; more than ordinary pretences, and gives greater ſhows of kindneſs to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but yet fails in performing that true and honeſt ſervice which it ought; it is for offering ſomething of its own, and thinks to pleaſe God with its little Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whilſt it denies him that which he requires of his; but theſe are but ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Characters and Deſcriptions of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. I proceed in the</p>
               <p n="2">2. Second place to conſider ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtances of it, and to examine a few of thoſe that are accounted ſuch and are not ſo. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. I account all the Heathen Polytheiſm, and Worſhip of many Deities, Heroes and Daemons, and their Inferior Gods to be the firſt and trueſt part of ſuperſtition,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60245:149"/>this is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the ſtricteſt ſence of that word, and was ſuch as the <hi>Athenians</hi> were greatly guilty of, and charged with it here by St. <hi>Paul;</hi> for all Idolatry, tho' it be a breach of the ſecond command, yet is truly ſuperſtition, which is ſaid to be a breach of the firſt; it ariſes from a very miſtaken notion of the true God, and from an immoderate fear of all thoſe other beings that it ſuppoſes under him; and next to him in power and other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; it thinks them worthy of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Honour and Veneration, and that they are the Authors of very great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and favours to mankind; and that they ought to have addreſſes made to them, to be pray'd to in ſickneſs and in danger, and under any affliction or extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: and ſo makes it ſelf a Penſioner to them, and lives not only under the fear and awe of thoſe, but under expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from, and dependencies upon thoſe as well as the ſupreme and the great God. This was the true ground of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Polytheiſm and Idolatry: They took the inferior Deities to be the Miniſters of State and Governors of the World under the Supreme, and they Worſhipt them as their immediate and particular Patrons; and as is plain from <hi>Maximus Tyrius,</hi> they accounted them their Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ators, by whom they made their addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:60245:149"/>to the greateſt God; this was thought by them to be an humble deference to him, who was too great to have imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate worſhip or prayers offer'd to him, by perſons ſo much below him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they made uſe of others; and ſo in time forgot the ſupreme, and paid no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offices to him at all, but gave away that honour and worſhip that was due only to him, to the meaneſt, and to the worſt of his Creatures, and even to the wicked Angels and to the Devils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: and how ſad was the ſuperſtition of the Heathen World, and how the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God was almoſt quite loſt among 'em, before the coming of our Saviour, who came to deſtroy all falſe worſhip and ſuperſtition, both the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and the Heathens themſelves ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently inform us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The next inſtance of ſuperſtition to the Heathen Polytheiſm and very near of kin to it, is that of worſhipping Saints and Angels, Images and Reliques, which is too notoriouſly practis'd in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> This is ſo rank and open a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, that it comes up to the trueſt Etymology of the Greek and Latin word, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which if good Beings are Angels, and the Souls that are departed, being the <hi>ſuperſtites</hi> that they ſuppoſe now living in Heaven, which agrees with the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60245:150"/>account that <hi>Tully</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> give of it. This worſhip of Angels was a very ancient ſuperſtition of ſome Heretical Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> cautions againſt, Coloſ. 2.18. <hi>Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Angels.</hi> This it ſeems was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a point of humility upon ſome account, I ſuppoſe upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they thought it too great a thing to addreſs to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of God, without the Angels as Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators: but beſides that, this is an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment upon the Office of Chriſt, who is the only Mediator between God and Man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. to chooſe other Mediators for our ſelves: It is the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Angels upon an Office, they were never appointed to by God, and a ſuperſtitious truſt and confidence placed in them, without any manner of ground, and <hi>intruding into thoſe things which we have not ſeen,</hi> Col. 2.18. and a new ſort of worſhip which the Scripture hath no where Commanded or Countenanc'd, but expreſly forbidden, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. And ſuch is the ſuperſtitious reverence given to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages and Reliques, as if there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing Sacred in them; or any Vertue to be expected by them, or the relation they had to the Perſon or Prototype were a ſufficient ground of giving religious Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60245:150"/>and Worſhip to them; I know not whether the folly of this ſuperſtition, or the ſin be greater, 'tis as low in many caſes as any almoſt among the Heathens: and the <hi>Egyptians</hi> worſhipping the ſpots upon the <hi>Apis,</hi> the <hi>Ibis</hi> and the Herbs of their Garden, as thinking a Divine Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue reſided in them, is very near as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and defenſible.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another inſtance of ſuperſtition, is to think to pleaſe God with greater acts of ſeverity and mortification than he has required, and to place a higher perfection in thoſe things, than in all the other parts of Religion, which God himſelf has commanded.</p>
               <p>This was a very early ſuperſtition in the very beginning of Chriſtianity, when ſome of the Hereticks were not contented with the plain and excellent duties of Faith and Love, and Meekneſs, and the like; but they muſt be for ſomething more ſingular and extraordinary, that made a greater ſhow of more abſtinence and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity and ſelf-denial, <hi>and had,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſays, <hi>a ſhow of wiſdom in will worſhip and humility and neglecting of the body,</hi> Col. 2.23. and they would deny themſelves all the Lawfull and Innocent pleaſures of Life, and would abſtain from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Wine and Fleſh, and uſe great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Watchings and Faſtings than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60245:151"/>Chriſtians generally did, and forbid all Meats and Marriages, with a <hi>touch not, taſt not, handle not;</hi> ſo <hi>Epiphanius</hi> tells us the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> did, and the <hi>Ebionitos,</hi> who were every day baptized and carefully abſtained from all Fleſh, and were ſo afraid of Wine, that they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the Euchariſt only in Water, and ſo were called <hi>Aquarii:</hi> And thus did <hi>Marcion</hi> and <hi>Montanus,</hi> and the <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees</hi> pretend all to very great abſtinencies and ſeverities, and affect ſomething very ſingular and ſelf-denying that Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty never requir'd of them; they thought that was too low in thoſe things, and they were therefore for adding to it ſome purer and higher precepts of ſtrictneſs, which neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver requir'd. 'Tis from theſe Schools of the Hereticks, that our Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks have learnt their rules of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and have ſet up their Monkiſh So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, like thoſe of the <hi>Eſſens</hi> and <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans,</hi> wherein they pretend to greater abſtinencies and ſelf-denials, and to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort of Chriſtianity than what the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel has any where commanded: but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Saviour knew as well as theſe Men wherein the perfection of Religion lay; and he has given us as perfect and ſublime Laws and Directions of Vertue, as could be; and however theſe greater
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60245:151"/>ſeverities look more plauſible and more ſelf-denying, yet they are forced and unnatural, a ſort of Stoical or Cynical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, rather than Chriſtian, a taking Men off from doing greater good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more uſefull to the World, a Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, a Diſparagement upon the Goſpel as not giving us the beſt rules and the moſt perfect precepts, but that we can invent better and higher our ſelves; and, in a word, a ſuperſtitious and unground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed belief that there is any thing evil or unlawfull in the Natural and Innocent Enjoyments that God has no where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden and reſtrain'd us from; and that the abſtaining from thoſe is a way bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to pleaſe God and to recommend our ſelves to him, than by living up to the plain and honeſt duties of the Goſpel. This part of ſuperſtition which lies in a ſhow of greater humility and ſeverity, and abſtinence, is mighty apt to cheat the World, and therefore it has been made uſe of generally by thoſe who would draw people into their Communion and Party; and it has done no little ſervice to the Papiſts on one ſide, who tell us of their vows of Poverty and Chaſtity, their hair ſhirts, and their other ſeverities; and the Quakers on the other ſide, who affect a ſhow of humility and ſingulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in their Garb and their Words, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60245:152"/>think that 'tis Religion not to ſpeak or be habited as other people, nor to uſe the common expreſſions of Civility and good Manners; but no where has Chriſt or his Religion Commanded us to be Cynicks, nor did he give us any ſuch example by any affected ſingularity in his own life; but has bid us live innocently and love one another, and told us that this is the perfection of Chriſtianity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhall know that we are his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and not by any Monkiſh ſeverities or ſuperſtitious abſtinencies and ſelf-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of what is Lawfull and Innocent; We may uſe thoſe upon account of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or by reaſon of ſome particular Circumſtances, but to place Religion in doing ſo, that is ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>I might name a great many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuperſtition in the Roman Church, in their Pilgrimages and viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Shrines, in their whipping them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and going bare-foot, in their Penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their Maſſes and Indulgencies; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they place Religion in very fooliſh and ridiculous things of no manner of worth or value, and think to pleaſe God and atone for their ſins, and reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Heaven, by ſuch performances as God has no where commanded, and are no way proper for it.</p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:60245:152"/>
               <p n="4">4. A great part of ſuperſtition lies in aſcribing a Divine Virtue and Power to ſuch things as are meerly natural and have no ſuch Virtue in them; as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king every accident a ſign of ſomething, as the Heathens did the flight of Birds, (<gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60245:153"/>Power, as the uſing Spells, Charms, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical knots, and Ligatures, and the like, which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls, <hi>execranda ſuperſtitìo;</hi> and the obſerving dreams and ſuch na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things, which proceed only from natural cauſes, as if there were ſomething Divine in them; this is a great ſpice of the Heathen ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A great part of Superſtition lies in pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the main ſubſtance of Religion, in ſome poſitive and external duties, that are only of leſſer value, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did in their keeping Faſts and Sabbaths, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sacrifices and obſerving Circumciſion, and the other Rites of their Law; which tho' they were commanded by God, yet the placing Religion chiefly in them, and not in inward Goodneſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was what the Prophets always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and reproved them for, as you may ſee, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.11. <hi>To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices to me, ſaith the Lord?

               <p n="6">6. Superſtition may lie in the opinion of indifferent things that are uſed for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and decency in religious worſhip, as if there were any true ſanctity on one ſide, or any real ſin on the other in the uſe of them. To ſay that no Indifferencies and Ceremonies muſt be uſed in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, but what he has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is to condemn the Jewiſh and the Chriſtian Church, and even all Parties in Religion, who can never worſhip God without ſome ſuch; and therefore 'tis true ſuperſtition to think there is a ſin in thoſe, and that God will be diſpleaſed at what is no way ſinfull and unlawfull in it ſelf, and is confeſs'd not to be ſo before it is impoſed, when it is impoſed for mere order and decency: ſo on the other ſide 'tis ſuperſtition to think there is any real ſanctity in thoſe, or that they are true parts, and not meerly Circumſtances of worſhip; that there is a real Goodneſs in the things themſelves and that they are a means to pleaſe God and procure his favour; and that there is ſuch a Vertue in them to do this meerly for themſelves, tho' there were no human authority re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them of us; As the <hi>Jews</hi> thought
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:60245:154"/>of the Traditions of their Elders.</p>
               <p>But the charge of ſuperſtition is brought nearer to us, and laid to our own Church, and it concerns us rather to vindicate our ſelves than to lay it upon others. We blame the Papiſts for placing Religion in ſuch things as God has not commanded, and for a ſuperſtitious uſe of ſeveral Rites and Ceremonies no where preſcribed in the Goſpel; but do not we our ſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame fault in uſing a great many Rites and Ceremonies in our worſhip, which are no where commanded of God, and are only human inventions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, and therefore ſuperſtitious? This therefore I deſign to enquire into, which is a great ſtumbling block to many who do not well underſtand ſuperſtition, and are ſuperſtitiouſly afraid of it, where there is no ſuch thing; nor are well acquainted with the nature and deſign of thoſe Rites which are uſed in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and what it ſelf teaches concerning them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore in this place examine whether to uſe any thing in the worſhip of God, which he himſelf has not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, be ſuperſtition; and to vindicate our Rites and Ceremonies from ſuch an imputation, and particularly thoſe bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acts of worſhip, which are moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected to be ſo, kneeling at the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60245:154"/>and the like; and that I may do this to the ſatisfaction of all perſons who do not reſolve that they will never be ſatisfied; I ſhall offer theſe ſeveral things about this matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be ſuperſtition to uſe any thing in the worſhip of God, which he himſelf has not commanded, and which is not preſcribed by a Divine Law, then the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters themſelves, be they of what Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Denomination ſoever, are very guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuperſtition; for they all of them uſe a great many things in their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God, for which there is no Divine Law or Command; as for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where is it Commanded that they ſhall uſe a conceived prayer of their own and not pray by a form? Where is it Commanded that they ſhould receive the Sacrament ſitting and not kneeling? Where is it Commanded that the Miniſter ſhall be cloathed in black, and ſhall not wear a Surplice when he Officiates? thoſe things that are in uſe among them are no more Commanded by a Law of God, than thoſe among us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If it be ſuperſtitious to uſe any thing in the worſhip of God, that God himſelf has not preſcribed, then what ſhall we think of ſeveral things that the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed in their worſhip, which God had not Commanded, and yet, both our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60245:155"/>and his Apoſtles complied with them, in 'em; as for Example, in all their Synagogue-worſhip, whither our Saviour and his Apoſtles often reſorted, and yet they had no Command for it in their Law, but only for their worſhip at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Tabernacle; They had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in their Law for Reading and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Moſes</hi> there every Sabbath day, as was accuſtomed, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.21. nor for that form of Prayer and Liturgy which they uſed there, and in which, no doubt, but our Saviour and his Apoſtles joyned with them; Nay, there was no expreſs Law for all their Temple worſhip, nor for building their Temple, nor for their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and their Hymns there, which were a great many of them appointed by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and their other Governors; there was no precept for their hours of Prayer, which were obſerved by the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.1. there was no Divine Command for the Feaſt of the Dedication, at which our Saviour was preſent, <hi>John</hi> 10.22. and yet he never in the leaſt reproved thoſe unappointed uſages as having any thing of ſuperſtition in them; but complied with them and countenanc'd them by his own Example: So in the Paſſover which is a very conſiderable rite and part of Jewiſh worſhip, our Saviour uſed the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of lying and diſcumbency in the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60245:155"/>of it, tho' that was not the poſture Commanded in the Law, and at the firſt inſtitution of it, <hi>Exodus</hi> 12.11. but taken up afterwards by the Jewiſh Church, when they were ſettled with eaſe and liberty in the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and the Cup of Charity alſo, that was not of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, yet this our Saviour u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo, after the manner of the <hi>Jews, Luke</hi> 22.17. and was pleaſed to conform to many innocent and inoffenſive rites of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church in their Divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, though they were not all of them expreſly Commanded or Preſcribed by God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The whole Chriſtian Church did uſe ſome things in their worſhip, which were no way Commanded by Chriſt. The Holy kiſs or the kiſs of Charity, which is mention'd <hi>Romans</hi> 16.16. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.14. was an outward ſymbol of Love and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which the Chriſtians uſed at their meeting at Prayers and the Sacrament; and ſuch were their Love Feaſts or Feaſts of Charity, which were Celebrated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Lords Supper, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>0. <hi>Jude</hi> 12. Theſe were only ſuch rites, as the Chriſtians, without any Command of Chriſt, thought fit to join with the moſt ſolemn parts of the Chriſtian wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and yet they were of ſo indifferent and alterable a nature that the Chriſtian
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60245:156"/>Church has thought it matter of prudence to lay them aſide; And whoever is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſtate of the Chriſtian Church in its pureſt times and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the Apoſtles, knows there were ſeveral Eccleſiaſtical rites appointed by the Governors of it, and ſeveral Canons made in their Synods and Councils concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indifferent things; as there was before by the Apoſtles in the Council of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> Acts 15.29. prudential rules and orders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>blood and things ſtrangled,</hi> which they then impos'd upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for that time, but yet the obligation of them does not continue: And he that will defend that Doctrine, that nothing is Lawfull in the worſhip of God, that is not preſcribed by himſelf, muſt not only condemn all the Reform'd Churches abroad, who both pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and teach otherwiſe in all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions; but the whole Catholick Church ever ſince Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which has found it neceſſary to appoint many external rites in their religious ſervice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is impoſſible in the nature of the thing to perform Divine worſhip with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome rites and uſages, that God has now here Commanded; nor is it poſſible to make Laws concerning theſe to reach all places, for they muſt alter according to the ſeveral Manners and Cuſtoms of different People and Countries. We muſt
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60245:156"/>worſhip God with all ſigns of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reverence, with reſpect and decency becoming ſo great a Majeſty; but the marks and outward ſigns of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour alter and change according to Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and Places, and People, that 'tis impoſſible particularly to determine them. As for Example, pulling off the Shoe is a ſign of Honour and Reverence in the Eaſtern Countries, as pulling off the Hat with us; and to this it is thought the precepts of the wiſe man alludes, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Keep thy foot when thou goeſt into the houſe of God,</hi> i. e. be carefull to ſhow all manner of Reverence in his preſence, as the <hi>Jews</hi> did, who always went barefoot into God's houſe, as the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> I think, do ſtill into their religious places; but this would be a very odd and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reverent thing with us. It was no irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence among the <hi>Jews</hi> to have their heads covered in Divine worſhip, at their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Sacrifices, when the Prieſts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly wore their Caps and Bonnets, and ſometimes Veils and other coverings; and ſo <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays it was accounted come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among the <hi>Romans</hi> to be covered at their worſhip, but among the <hi>Graecians</hi> it was quite otherwiſe, and at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where St. <hi>Paul</hi> declares it to be an act of irreverence, for the Men to Pray or Propheſie, having the head covered, 1.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60245:157"/>
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4. tho' it was otherwiſe for the Women. And therefore ſince matter of decency and order depends upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Cuſtoms and Places, and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and is in it ſelf variable and muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; there cannot be a Law given to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it in all places; nor is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have all the little Rites and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of religious worſhip be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in a Divine Law; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifth place, God has left thoſe to be determined by particular Churches and Governors, and has only command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſubſtantials of his worſhip, and given general Rules for <hi>all things to be done decently and in order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. and for mutual edification; and the leſſer circumſtances and adjuncts that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Divine worſhip, thoſe he has leſt undetermined and indifferent; and thoſe to whom he has committed the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, they are to ſettle thoſe for prevention of confuſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, according to the rules of Prudence and thoſe general meaſures which God has given in the Goſpel. It is plain he has no where Commanded them himſelf, nor can there be any particular directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for them produced out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and as plain it is that there would be perpetual confuſion and diſorder in
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:60245:157"/>the Church if theſe were not appointed in ſeveral places, by thoſe who are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of it: and when they are ſo they are to be obeyed and obſerved, when there is nothing in them that is contrary to a Law of God; they cannot be unlawfull, when no Law forbids them, but they may become neceſſary in their uſe, when they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in their nature, by a Lawfull Authority 's commanding them; and ſurely there can be no ſin or ſuperſtition in them upon that account. Which that I may then clear the particular Ceremonies and Impoſitions of our Church from, I ſhall ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry freely and openly give you my thoughts in ſome farther particulars, about the lawfull and the ſuperſtitious uſe of theſe things in the worſhip of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I own that there ought to be no new parts of worſhip other than what God himſelf has appointed; there may be new circumſtances and adjuncts appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but no real and ſubſtantial parts of Divine worſhip: As for Example no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Authority can inſtitute new Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does, or more Sacramental parts of worſhip, than thoſe two which Chriſt himſelf has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to wit, Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper; but whether Baptiſm ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by ſprinkling or by dipping, that is but a circumſtance which the Church may determine, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60245:158"/>of the Climate or the ſtrength of the Child, or the ſeaſon of the year; and is left to every Miniſter's diſcretion in his own Church, and ſo alſo whether it ſhall be by ſingle or a trine immerſion; this, as not being an eſſential of Baptiſm, has been variouſly determined. So in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sacrament none can add or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from an eſſential part of Chriſt's own Inſtitution, as the Papiſts do in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving the Laity of the Cup; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall take this in a poſture of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or kneeling, or (which is very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent) ſtanding, is not eſſential to it, but what the Church may appoint, as it thinks moſt becoming ſo ſolemn a Duty, and moſt ſuiting the Prayers and Devotions that are joyn'd with it, which no doubt kneeling is. So farther to uſe Adoration and Invocation to God alone, and not to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or Saints, is a neceſſary duty; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhould pray to God with a form or without it, this is not neceſſary, tho' the former be much more convenient in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, to prevent the many faults and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decencies of extemporary effuſions: ſo whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we adore God by bowing, or by proſtration, or by kneeling, or by ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as the ancient Church did between Eaſter and Pentecoſt, is only a new man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or circumſtance of adoration, not a new act or part of it. And this I have the more carefully illuſtrated, that we
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60245:158"/>may ſee the difference between parts of worſhip, and only accidents and appenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and circumſtances of worſhip; The Church of <hi>England</hi> appoints only the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not any ſubſtantial worſhip or any parts of it, but what God himſelf has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as will appear farther.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That which is in it ſelf very Lawfull and Innocent may become ſuperſtitious by the opinion which he that uſes it, has of it; as if he thinks it is a means to pleaſe God, and procure his favour, and that it has ſuch a vertue in it ſelf to do this, as that God would be pleaſed with us for the doing this, and diſpleaſed with us if we ſhould not do it, meerly for it ſelf, tho' there were no human Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that required it of us; as the <hi>Jews</hi> thought that their waſhing of their hands would pleaſe God, and that it was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement of their Conſciences to eat with unwaſhen hands, which was the miſtake our Saviour reproves them for, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.20. their ſuperſtitious opinion of that Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and the Tradition of their Elders to think that it was a piece of Sanctity and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to waſh their hands, and that it was a ſin and real defilement of their Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not to do it; to aſcribe a true ſpiritual Vertue to an outward Ceremony, as that it expiated inward guilt, and was not a meer indifferent matter of decency, which was the true fault of the <hi>Jews</hi> in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60245:159"/>And ſuch a ſuperſtitious opinion the Papiſts have of their Holy Water, that it cleanſes them from venial ſins, and drives away the Devil; as they alſo ſay of the ſign of the Croſs, that it has a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per efficiency againſt the power of the Devil; and that their Ceremonies have a real efficacy, and produce ſpiritual ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects upon thoſe that uſe them; that they are operative of Grace, or that they have any proper and real goodneſs in them, antecedent to the Command of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and their being ſubſervient to meet order and decency, and to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſolemnity of Religion. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed makes them ſuperſtitious, and this the Phariſees thought of their Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and therefore <hi>taught for Doctrines the Commandments of Men,</hi> Matthew 15.9. i. e. their own commands and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, as if they had had a like Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority and Inſtitution, and had had an equal Authority if not ſuperiour to the Laws of God; for they ſometimes made void the Law of God by their Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. But this the Church of <hi>England</hi> wholly diſclaims, and therefore in the</p>
               <p n="3">3. Third place, its own declarations concerning the nature and uſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of all its Rites and Ceremonies do ſufficiently vindicate it, from the leaſt ſhadow or ſemblance of ſuperſtition. It declares that it looks on the Rites and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60245:159"/>Ceremonies uſed in the Liturgy, as things in their own nature indifferent and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable, and that changes and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be made as ſeems neceſſary or expedient to thoſe in Authority; and that every Country is at liberty to uſe their own Ceremonies, and that it neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns others nor preſcribes to them. Theſe are its own words in the Preface to the Common Prayer, and there is moſt excellent Temper and Wiſdom in them; it declares that they are appointed only for order and decency, and not for any virtue or ſpiritual efficacy; it declares concerning kneeling at the Sacrament, that it is only a decent poſture, and that it is not deſign'd to give any Adoration to the Elements. Concerning the Croſs in Baptiſm it makes it no part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but owns the Child to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd without it, and requires it not in private Baptiſm, and that 'tis only a ſign that the Child is become the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Crucifi'd Jeſus, and is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd to wear his Badge upon it; it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes no peculiar holineſs to its Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies as the Papiſts do to theirs; it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes no ſpiritual vertue and efficacy, nor makes them operative of Grace, but declares that they are only for order and decency, and are indifferent in their own nature, even after they are determined, and that they are required only by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:60245:160"/>of that general obedience that we owe to lawfull Authority. And he that will think there is any ſuperſtition in theſe, may in time come to the Quakers prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and think it ſuperſtition to pull off his hat; but ſo far is the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from all the ſuperſtitions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Church, and ſo wiſe and moderate in its whole conſtitution, that as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it in my Conſcience to be the beſt Church in the World, and the fartheſt from Superſtition; ſo I do not at all doubt but the Papiſts themſelves as well as others have raiſed and promoted this loud out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry of ſuperſtition againſt it, as knowing that it is the greateſt Enemy to their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious worship, and that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to bring in their fopperies and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, till the manly and decent worship of the Church of <hi>England</hi> be run down and deſtroyed; which God in his mercy prevent, and which, I hope, our Diſſenting Brethren will endeavour to prevent alſo, if they are truly Enemies to ſuperſtition. But in the</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourth place I muſt plainly tell 'em that they are more guilty of ſuperſtition in avoiding the Communion of our Church for the ſake of thoſe indifferent Rites and Ceremonies, than that is for impoſing 'em; for it is as truly ſuperſtition to think God will be offended at little things, and diſpleaſed with us for doing what is no way ſinfull or unlawfull, as to think
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60245:160"/>he will be pleaſed with us for what is indifferent, and no way good in its ſelf. Superſtition does as often proceed from an anxious and ungrounded fear as from a fond and vain hope; and as he is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious in the outward things of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who lays a greater ſtreſs upon them than they deſerve, who thinks Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion lies in them, and that God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with them meerly for themſelves; ſo he is as truly ſo, who thinks there is a great evil or ſin in them, and avoids them upon that account and thinks he ſhould diſpleaſe God, if he should obſerve 'em. This is not only diſobedience to our Governors, and to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Authority which is a great ſin, when they command nothing that is unlawfull, that is contrary to any law of God; for if we muſt not obey them in ſuch a caſe, we muſt obey them in nothing at all, if we muſt not obey them in thing; indifferent; and if it be a ſin to obey them in ſuch a caſe, it is a ſin that neither God nor Man have made ſo, but the quite contrary. Beſides this I ſay, and the breach of Chriſtian Unity, and the horrid guilt of Schiſm and Separation which can never be juſtified but where things unlawfull and not things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different are Commanded and made Terms of Communion; beſides this, I ſay, it is truly ſuperſtition to think it unlawfull to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with us, for the ſake of indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Ceremonies; to think God is offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:60245:161"/>or diſpleaſed at what is in it ſelf very innocent, and is confeſt by themſelves to be ſo in its own nature before it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I come now to conſider the laſt and third head of diſcourſe; that is the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the Cure of ſuperſtition. And as to the Cauſes they are as many and the ſame, as of falſe Religion or falſe Worship of God, for that is the notion of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition; 'tis a religious ſenſe of the mind mixt with great error and darkneſs; nay, 'tis not only Religion blind, but crazed and diſtemper'd too; in ſome 'tis come to a perfect rage and diſtraction; as in the bloody and barbarous ſuperſtitions of the Heathens, who offer'd up their Slaves and Children as Sacrifices to their Deities, and thought it Religion to murder themſelves and ſprinkle the Altars with human gore; in others the frenzy is not ſo high nor does it work ſo ſtrongly, but puts 'em only upon foolish, and antick, and ſilly ways of worshipping and pleaſing God, and diſcovers it ſelf in leſſer ſymptoms. It is the deſign of ſuperſtition to pleaſe the Deity, but it uſes wrong ways, and does ſomething that is very improper in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to its Deſign. It is very forward in Religion, and like the Clown that would be very mannerly and over officious, but knows not how, and ſo commits a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60245:161"/>rudeneſſes and indecencies in his awkard deportment; ſo does the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious make shows and appearances of courtship to Heaven, but he is out in all of them, and does not what is proper, what is really obliging and acceptable to it.</p>
               <p>The Devil not being able to deſtroy the religious ſenſe that is in our minds, not being able to root out that which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has planted in every man's breaſt, a ſenſe of a God and a Divine Being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us; he endeavours to ſpoil and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt that as much as he can, and to ſow ſuch cockle and tares among the good and natural ſeed of religion as may quite choke it and make it unfruitfull; as may alter its kind, and make it produce ſuch fruit as is not true and genuine, but quite of another nature, as looks like religion, and like the Apples of <hi>Sodom</hi> ſeem more fair outwardly, but is another thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; becauſe he cannot hinder men from being Religious, but there is ſomething within themſelves will make them ſo in ſpite of all his attempts and deſigns to the contrary, therefore he will make 'em ſuperſtitious; becauſe he cannot ſtop the religious inſtinct and inclination of their minds, he will determine and ſet it wrong; becauſe he cannot dry up that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſpring of Religion that riſes up in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60245:162"/>every ones breaſt, he will poyſon and corrupt it; and becauſe Religion is ſo deeply and ſtrongly rooted in human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it can never be wholly pluck'd up by him, therefore he will graft up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſuch falſe and ſuperſtitious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as ſhall quite alter it's nature; and tho' they are fed and nouriſh'd by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſenſe at the bottom, yet this vine ſhall bring forth Thorns, and this Fig-tree Thiſtles, and from this ſweet Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſhall come forth Salt and bitter Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: by a ſuperſtitious mixture Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhall be changed and perverted, both in its nature and its effects; This is the ſaddeſt miſchief to true Religion, that it ſhould be thus made to deſtroy it ſelf, that its force and power ſhould be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon its ſelf, and it ſhould be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med like ſome Animals by what grows out of it ſelf: 'Tis thus the Devil moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully countermines God, and deſtroys Religion, by turning it into ſuperſtition, which how it is done, and by what means effected, I ſhall endeavour to ſhow you in three prrticulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By making Men vitious and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for tho' ſuperſtition may often grow up in weak and ſilly minds that may be innocent and far from being guilty of very great and notorious vices; yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the firſt and moſt general cauſe of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60245:162"/>ſuperſtition in the World is Vice and Wickedneſs; the Devil has firſt drawn Men to that, and then has led them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all manner of errors and falſhoods; he has firſt debauch'd their morals and then their underſtandings; he has firſt wrought upon their Wills and Affections by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable Luſts and Vices, and then he has quickly corrupted their Judgments and led 'em into all manner of miſtakes in Religion. The ſuperſtition of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then World aroſe, I doubt not, from that horrible corruption of manners that was among them; they would never have ſet up ſuch a Religion as they did, made up of nothing almoſt but obſcenity and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, cruelty and blood, apiſhneſs and folly, had not they been as the Apoſtle repreſents the Heathen World, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>Vain in their imaginations and fill'd with all</hi> manner of <hi>unrighteouſneſs, implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> and <hi>unmercifull</hi> in their own tempers, and given up to the moſt beaſtly Luſts and unnatural Lewdneſſes; theſe Vices in themſelves naturally lead them to ſuch a falſe Religion and ſuch ſuperſtitious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations as they were guilty of. But as their manners decay'd ſo did the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and the right worſhip of God, and as vice got ground ſo did ſuperſtition, and they always grew up and encreaſed, and like <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his Twins, lived and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60245:163"/>together. What hidden cauſe thus link<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them together, and how they came to be ſuch inſeparable Companions may ſeem ſtrange when ſuperſtition owns and acknowledges a God, has a great ſenſe of him upon the mind; but if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that this ſenſe of a God, when it has not had ſuch a due effect as it ought upon it, ſo as to preſerve it vertuous and Innocent, but Luſt and Wickedneſs and the Temptations of the Devil have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it; this ſenſe of its own Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs joyned with the ſenſe of a God, does very naturally and eaſily bring it to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. If it had no ſenſe of a God, nor no belief of ſuch a being at all; if it could get rid of that, which it never can, then indeed there would be no ground of ſuperſtition, and this way the Atheiſt would free himſelf from all ſuperſtitious fears: or if it were not vicious and ſo not ſenſible of its own horrid guilt and wickedneſs and its obnoxiouſneſs to this God above, neither then would it be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious; but when it is thus ſenſible of a great and juſt God, which is the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſuch crimes as it knows it has been highly guilty of, this is the firſt thing that brings it to ſuperſtition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the</p>
               <pb n="285" facs="tcp:60245:163"/>
               <p n="2">2. Second place this cauſes a dreadfull fear and terrible apprehenſion of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; its own guilt ſcares and affrights it and draws terrible Ideas and Images of God upon its mind, ſo that it looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him only as a Malefactor does upon his ſevere Judge, his Jailor, or his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner: it ſees nothing but frowns in his face, and anger in his eyes, and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Lightning in his hand, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies all the Inſtrumenes of Torture and Puniſhment ready to be applied to it; And in ſuch a caſe as this is, what would it not do to pacifie and appeaſe this Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that it thus dreads? what a dreadfull fright and paſſion muſt it be in, when it can think of nothing that will do it? how will it be trying every thing it can think of? <hi>Come before his altars and bring thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of rams, and ten thouſand rivers of oyl,</hi> if it were rich enough, <hi>and give its firſt born for its transgreſſion, and part with the fruit of its own body for the ſin of its ſoul,</hi> Micah 6.7. and ſhed its own blood for to make ſome expiation for its guilt? Nothing is ſo mean and ſervile, nothing ſo cruel and bloody, ſo shamefull and ſcandalous, but a Soul overwhelmed with a ſuperſtitious fear, will be attempting and trying, be it never ſo unagreeable to the Divine Nature, and never ſo unfit and unſuitable to pleaſe him: there is juſt
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60245:164"/>ground of being afraid of God, when we are ſenſible of our guilt, and 'tis not this is ſuperſtition; but when this fear puts Men upon foolish and undue, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ways to appeaſe him, and gives us ſuch a dreadfull Idea and Apprehenſion of him as quite excludes all the thoughts of his Goodneſs and Mercy, and puts the mind only into an exceſſive fright and fit of horror, then it is ſo. I cannot think that ever mankind would have formed ſuch a conception of God, had not their guilt been the medium, thro' which they beheld him; there is nothing in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature should cauſe this ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dread of him, nor draw him in ſuch black and ghaſtly features as theſe are; but no wonder that God looks very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to a very wicked and a very guilty mind; eſpecially in the</p>
               <p n="3">3. Third place, when it is ignorant of any true and certain way to pleaſe or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe God, to procure his favour or avert his anger, which is the other cauſe of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; the ſuperſtitious are a ſort of timerous perſons that are always in the dark, where they have frightfull Images always before them, and black and ghaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apparitions riſe up in their fancies, and they know not which way to turn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor how to avoid the furies and ſpectres of their own thoughts; They
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60245:164"/>cannot tell how to deliver themſelves from this ſad ſtate, and thus anxious and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they apply themſelves to any Saint or any Daemon, be it good or bad, that they are told can help them; they run to the altar, and throw on any thing that may free 'em from punishment: like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a Tempeſt, they'll part with their richeſt goods to ſave themſelves; they'll perform every Rite and go through e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Myſtery, and undergo any kind of Pennance; they'll whip themſelves and walk bare-foot, and run to the ſhrines of any Saint; and whatever ſuperſtitious ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance ſhall adviſe 'em to, this they'll comply withal, and all out of great fear and ſilly ignorance, and not knowing what it is that will truly recommend 'em to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and procure the Divine favour. And therefore as to the Cure of ſuperſtition, which is the laſt thing I am to ſpeak to, I account a right knowledge of Religion, and a true conception of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to be the cure and remedy for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; and by this way our bleſſed Saviour, who came to deſtroy all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and falſe worship out of the World, has moſt effectually accomplish'd his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, by aſſuring us that God is a Being of infinite Goodneſs and Compaſſion to his Creatures, who is not apt to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry nor provoked with little matters, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:60245:165"/>who is very placable and willing to be reconciled whenever we have done a great fault that truly offends him; who is not a peevish and angry Maſter whom it is impoſſible to pleaſe, but a kind and gentle Father whom nothing but will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſobedience and impudent unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs will anger and diſpleaſe; who tho' he is not a ſoft and eaſie Being, who is to be flattered with shows, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon by little tricks and ſorry per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances; yet we may be ſure to oblige him by being honeſt and ſincere and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what lies in our power; who, tho' we have a great many imperfections and a great many frailties, yet will accept whatever we offer him in the integrity of our hearts; and will not be extreme or ſevere to mark what is done amiſs; or take advantage of the unavoidable fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lures of Human Nature: who is ſo far from that, that he has provided a certain remedy for our moſt wilfull miſcarriages, and declared himſelf ready to pardon the moſt hainous offences of the greateſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners upon the moſt equitable and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous terms that can be deſired. Such a repreſentation of God and the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as this is which Chriſtianity has given us, is enough to banish all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious fear and unreaſonable dread of him; this will remove all that anxious
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:60245:165"/>and perplexing aſtoniſhment, which we might otherwiſe be oppreſt withal, when we look'd up to an Almighty power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove us, and were uncertain how he would deal with us, and would not tell by what ways we ſhould either purchaſe his good will or avoid his diſpleaſure. Now we know very certainly how we may do that, by living vertuouſly, and obſerving the eternal Laws of Goodneſs and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, by a hearty penitence for all our paſt faults, and a ſincere obedience for the time to come; by living up to the excellent rules of the Goſpel, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Example of our Bleſſed Maſter. By a true underſtanding and an honeſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Chriſtian Religion, we ſhall be delivered from all the fears and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, from all the darkneſs and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſuperſtition; and that we may be ſo, I ſhall add further two Rules or Advices to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us bring our minds truly to love God: This the ſuperſtitious perſon does not, he is afraid of God and trembles at the thoughts of him, as a Slave does at the ſight of his mercileſs Patron; but he wiſhes there were no ſuch being as he fanſios God to be, and it would be the moſt joyfull thing in the World if he could get out of his irreſiſtible power. He finds indeed that is impoſſible; and ſo he crouches to
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60245:166"/>him, as a Captive does to his Inſolent Conqueror, that has him in Chains and leads him in Triumph tyed to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot Wheels; but he hates him in his heart even while he prays to him; and when he bows the moſt ſubmiſſively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, his heart within riſes up againſt him, and there he curſes him, whilſt he flatters him with his lips. Such a black and diſmal apprehenſion the ſuperſtitious perſon has of God, whom he fanſies to be a cruel, ſevere, angry, touchy Being, an Almighty power without goodneſs; which is to make him an infinite evil, inſtead of a good, and an Almighty Tyrant, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Righteous God. This makes it impoſſible for him to love him; he may worſhip him, but 'tis as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſays, ſome ſaluted thoſe Tyrants and built Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues to them whom they would have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and dethroned, had it been in their power; he may come to the Temple, but as he ſays, 'tis as if it were to the neſts of Dragons, or the Caves of wild Beaſts, for he imagines the God that dwells there to be as hurtfull and miſchievous as any of thoſe, only more powerfull, and he has juſt ſuch a conception of him, as the <hi>Indians</hi> of the Devil whom yet they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. I know no greater blaſphemy to the Divine Nature, than to conceive thus of it, as the ſuperſtitious perſon doth; nor
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60245:166"/>no worſe Idolatry than to ſet up ſuch an Idol of fear and terror in our Souls, inſtead of the great and good God. I will not ſay as ſome do, that Atheiſm is better than this, to deny a God than to think thus ill of him; but this is certain that the ſuperſtitious would be an Atheiſt if he durſt, and 'tis much againſt his Will, his Wiſhes, and his Inclinations, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is a God; and therefore to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all ſuperſtitious and undue fear of God, let us avoid all ſuch falſe notions and miſapprehenſions of him, as will make it impoſſible for us to love him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us love and practice Vertue and Goodneſs, and only by that means hope to commend our ſelves to God, and fit our ſelves for Heaven, and ſo we ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void moſt of the little tricks, the cheats and devices of ſuperſtition; the deſign of thoſe is to ſuperſede honeſt Vertue and inward Goodneſs, and by ſome other ways to think to purchaſe the Divine Favour and the Happineſs of Heaven. 'Tis very hard and difficult to men to be inwardly good and exactly vertuous, to drive out eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry known ſin, and live in the practice of every duty, which is the plain and the honeſt path-way to Heaven; and therefore ſuperſtition would find out other by-roads and eaſier paſſages, and would have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion lie in more eaſie and outward per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances;
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:60245:167"/>and would relieve it ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that ſtrait and narrow way, which the Goſpel directs us to, and would have it ſuffice to be ſent to Heaven by an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution or an Indulgence. Thus by a Paſs, as it were, by the Prieſt or Pope to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, by making a ſhort Confeſſion, and being a little contrite and abſolved and anointed on the Death-Bed, the work is quickly done, and as well he thinks as if the Man had lived a Saint, or died a Martyr; or if he had been ſo Religious in his life time, as to tell over his Beads every day, and carry a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix always about him, and perform the Pennance of his Confeſſor, and gone a few Pilgrimages to a few Saints, then he has done ſuch works as are very merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, tho' his Saviour never Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of them; and he muſt be thought to be very Religious, tho' 'tis ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion as the Goſpel is a perfect ſtranger to. But Superſtition is for placing Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in ſome other things than the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel does, in ſome inventions of its own, in ſome little and eaſie and trifling performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in ſome of the externals and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Religion; in a ſtrict obſervance of ſome leſſer duties, and a zealous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for inconſiderable matters, in being over forward for the little adjuncts and appendages of Religion, but very negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60245:167"/>of that, which is the true life and ſubſtance of it; and in vainly believing to pleaſe God by ſome other things than by a righteous and good mind, and the practice of univerſal Holineſs. Thus did the <hi>Jews</hi> think that often waſhing their Hands would make their Souls clean; that to obſerve the leſſer duties of the Law and the Rites and Traditions of their Elders, was the way to render them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Holy and Religious, though they foully neglected the weightier duties of Judgment, Mercy and Truth. Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition will often overdo in ſome parts of Religion, and therefore puts on the face of greater ſanctity, and is a kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in Religion; but 'tis at the bottom a great defect, a want of true and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward goodneſs, and it would ſupply that defect by other ſhows and appearances, and a mighty zeal in little things; it would compound as it were with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and commute its ſorry and worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs performances for actions of true and ſubſtantial goodneſs: It always lays too much value upon the little things of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and does but little eſteem and not heartily love Morality and inward Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore the trueſt principle to free us from all ſuperſtitious follies and miſtakes in Religion, is this, That nothing will pleaſe God, but being truly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60245:168"/>good; that nothing will commend us to his favour, but a Vertuous Mind and a Holy Life, and the ſincere practice of all the moral ſubſtantial duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and that without thoſe all other little things in Religion will be vain and idle and inſignificant, which is the trueſt principle in the World, and the beſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt Superſtition.</p>

               <p>THe Reſurrection of the dead is an Article of our Faith, of that weight and importance, that as it confirms and ſtrengthens all natural Religion, (for if Mens bodies riſe, moſt undoubtedly there is a future State) ſo it is the very Baſis and Foundation of Chriſtianity, without which our Faith in Chriſt is, as the Apoſtle ſays, vain and ungrounded. It ſeems not ſo neceſſary indeed for the truth of Religion
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60245:169"/>in general, to believe the Reſurrection of the fleſh or body, ſince the Soul without that may be capable of Happineſs or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery in another ſtate; and the belief of this alone may be ſufficient to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Vertue and Religion: But Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity lays a very great ſtreſs upon it, makes the Reſurrection of the body as neceſſary and fundamental an Article up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome accounts, as the immortality of the ſoul; and this becauſe of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Bleſſed Saviour, which as 'tis the great demonſtration of the truth of our Religion, ſo it is an Argument of the Reſurrection of all other Humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; for if he be riſen again with the ſame Body, with which he lived, and with that is gone into the Heavens, it's fit we ſhould follow him thither with our bodies too, with our whole Humane Nature, which he was pleaſed not only to aſſume upon Earth, but to carry up to be an Inhabitant of the manſions above; if he our head be raiſed, we his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers muſt be raiſed with him; he the firſt fruits from the dead, has by his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection Conſecrated our Bodies to Life and Immortality. It would be very ſtrange if he ſhould carry his Humane Body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, were there no others of the ſame nature to follow him, ſo that as the Apoſtle argues, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.13. <hi>If
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60245:169"/>there be no Reſurrection of the dead then is Chriſt not riſen.</hi> It does therefore high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern us to maintain and defend this main poſt, and ſtrongeſt hold of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by which our Chriſtianity muſt either ſtand or fall; and that the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Infidelity and Irreligion is moſt apt to be making its attempts and aſſaults up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it in this place, the weakeſt as is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed which belongs to it, and to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this article above all others, as an impoſſible and incredible thing. There were found not only among the <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſome of the Sect of <hi>Epicurus</hi> proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, who when they heard of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection mocked at it, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.32. and <hi>Pliny,</hi> I remember, reckons it among one of the things that exceed the power of God, <hi>revocare defunctos;</hi> but even amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> there were ſome known to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who thought it a thing unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and unfit to be believed, to whom he directs himſelf in this his defence of Chriſtianity; the Sadduces were a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and prevailing Sect among them, who ſay there is no Reſurrection, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angel nor Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.8. There are too many of their mind in our days, who cannot believe or conceive any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or immaterial ſubſtances; and who cannot think that a body after it has been dead, and lain rotting ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:60245:170"/>or thouſand years, and been diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into ten thouſand atoms, and ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into as many different places, and had a thouſand other bodies made out of it, that this ſhould be brought together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and riſe the ſame body it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Againſt theſe modern Sadduces and Unbelievers, theſe pretenders to Reaſon and Philoſophy, who expoſe the articles of revealed Religion, and eſpecially this of the Reſurrection, I ſhall endeavour to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Chriſtianity, and to make good St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s queſtion to them of old, <hi>Why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible that God ſhould raiſe the dead;</hi> or what that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion plainly implys, The Reſurrection is not in it ſelf an incredible thing. And this I ſhall do by theſe following conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are a great many other things which we ſee and know to be true and have no manner of doubt of, which if we conſider and endeavour to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, they ſeem as puzling and difficult to our reaſon as the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we take in the almighty power and infinite Wiſdom of God, this will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all the difficulty and incredibility that ſeems to be in the Reſurrection.</p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:60245:170"/>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt take in this, the power and wiſdom of God, or elſe we cannot be able to give account not only of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, but not of any the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monland ordinary appearance in nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our not knowing the particular uſes and purpoſes that our bodies ſhall ſerve for after they are raiſed, ſhould not make the Reſurrection incredible to us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If we conſider how far the body which is raiſed, is to be the ſame with that which is buried and corrupted, we ſhall not think it ſo incredible that God ſhould raiſe the dead.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are a great many other things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe unbelieving <hi>Sadduces</hi> and wary <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers,</hi> who dare not let their thoughts go beyond viſible nature, nor ſtep any thing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into revelation than reaſon ſhall guide and go along with them, may yet find a great many things there as puzling and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable as the Reſurrection, and which they would think as incredible too, were they not common and frequent; They cannot imagine how a body when it has been corrupted many years and turned into duſt, and all its parts ſeparated and divided, and mixt with a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, ſhould have all thoſe again united and brought together into the ſame vital frame and lively <hi>Compages:</hi> and can they imagine how this body of theirs
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60245:171"/>could be formed at firſt, and have all its various and different parts made out of a principle as unlikely for an humane body to riſe out of at firſt, as out of the duſt afterwards? Can they comprehend how the <hi>Pullus</hi> or Chick ſhould be hatch'd out of the Egg, how the <hi>Colliquamentum</hi> ſhould be ſet on moving, and the <hi>Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricula</hi> begin the firſt race of life? and what ſhould guide the unthinking mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to draw every vital part without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny error? and beſides, all other things how Bones, and Claws, and Feathers ſhould grow out of a mere fluid? As well one would think might we conceive a Ship with its Keel, Sails and all its Tack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be made out of the Water, in which it ſloats; and the ſtrongeſt Caſtles to be built, if not in the air, yet out of it, as all the ſtrong and ſolid parts of an Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals Body, its Bones, and Muſcles, and Cartilages to be formed as they are. Thou <hi>who thinkeſt it incredible for a dead and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted body to ariſe again, thou wouldſt think it as incredible to have any animals bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy formed as it is, if there were not every day a thouſand inſtances of it. Thou who knoweſt not how that can be done, knoweſt as little what is the way of the ſpirit,</hi> as the wiſe man ſpeaks, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.5. or how life is firſt given to the Embryo, or how the Bone; do grow in the Womb: Nay thou
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60245:171"/>as little knoweſt the manner how this body of ours can be nouriſhed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired; how that which is in continual flux by perſpiration, and has ſome of its parts dying as it were and departing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment, ſo that we are not the ſame in a leſs time than every ſeven years; how this ſhould be made new, and the Milky Chyle repair all the waſted parts of the Body, and conſequently be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Bones and Sinews, it's not eaſie to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count even for this daily Reſurrection, as it were, and continual reſtoring of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying bodies. But I need ſend theſe doubters and unbelievers of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, only to that Emblem of it which the Apoſtle has given, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. that of Corn ſown or buried in the ground, which ſeems there firſt to die and corrupt, and then it paſſes through abundance of alterations, ſhoots into a ſtringy root and graſſy top, grows into a ſtem, a ſtalk, an ear, and ſome of the leaſt of Seeds waxes a great Tree, ſo that the Fowls of the air may lodge in the branches of it; and yet theſe after they are ſo altered and quite loſt, one would think in the various Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphoſes they have paſſed thro'; have every Seed its own body given it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, as the Apoſtle expreſſes it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.37. and riſe as it were again the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame ſort and ſpecies, tho' it be mixt
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60245:172"/>with a thouſand others. This ſeems al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ſtrange, if we reflect upon it, as the Reſurrection of our bodies after all their corruptions and alterations; and it might be thought as incredible too, if it were not frequent and familiar to us: As there are a great many appearances in nature, which tho' common and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded; yet to thoſe who are ſtrangers to them, they ſeem impoſſible and no way to be believed. The works of God and Nature have ſo much of wonder in them beyond all humane Conception and Underſtanding, that if they were not dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before our Eyes, we ſhould think them as incredible as thoſe difficult matters which ſome complain of in Revelation. But I need offer but one <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of Nature, to repreſent the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by.</p>
               <p>And that is that Revolution of Nature which we call the Spring, which is the general Reſurrection as it were of terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial nature; in which after it has grown old and hoary in Winter, dead as it were and ſtiff with cold, and every part of it was ſhrunk, and crept into its grave, and been lock'd up there as in a cold Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, yet how in the ſpring does it reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver life again? how is a vigorous warmth diffuſed into it? and how on a ſudden is all the beauty and gayety, all the ſtrength
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60245:172"/>and vigor, the health and fruitfullneſs of youth beſtowed upon it? every Plant and Herb and Flower, revives and flouriſhes and puts on as it were a new and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body, and yet every one its own body. And how this ſhould be, and how every dry tree ſhould bloom and bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and have life and ſay conveyed to its withered branches, and the ſame juice turned into leaves and buds and fruit of ſo many kinds; This ſeems as ſtrange as how dry Bones ſhould live, and how fleſh and ſinews ſhould again come upon a Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.8. and all we, who dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee theſe wonderfull things before our Eyes, theſe conſtant Miracles of Nature, which if we conſider and endeavour to give account of, are as puzling and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult as the Reſurrection; <hi>Why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible</hi> with us and eſpecially with any curious ſearcher of Nature, <hi>that God ſhould raiſe the dead?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If we take in the almighty Power and Wiſdom of God, this will remove all the difficulty and incredibility that ſeems to be in the thing: So that the very firſt principle of Religion will make all the difficulty of the Reſurrection vaniſh; the conſidering that there is an infinite Being who has power ſufficient to do every thing that implies not a contradiction, and is not in the nature of the thing utterly
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60245:173"/>impoſſible or contrary to ſome ſtanding and fundamental principle of truth and certainty, nor does any way reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his other perfections of Wiſdom, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Goodneſs; this will make the whole thing very eaſie to us: for how eaſie will it be to him who put every part of matter into that regular order that conſtitutes the Heavens above and earth below, and all Plants and Animals that are upon it, he who founded the Earth by his power and ſtretched out the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens by his underſtanding as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks: <hi>He who telleth the number of the Stars, and calleth them all by their names,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 147.4. He who made and moved and knows, and permeates every part of matter that is in the vaſt Creation, and ranks and orders it in its due place; how cannot he put and bring together all the ſcattered parts of our dead bodies? He from whom our ſubſtance was not hid when we were <hi>made in ſecret, and curiouſly wrought in the loweſt parts of the Earth,</hi> Pſam. 139.15. <hi>whoſe Eyes did ſee our ſubſtance, yet being unperfect, and in whoſe Book were all our members written, which in continuance were faſhioned when as yet there was none of them, v.</hi> 16. how cannot he alſo as eaſily know and rejoin all the parts and members of our corrupted bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:60245:173"/>He by whom the very hairs of our heads are numbred, how eaſie will it be for him to know the body of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, and every part and Member of that body; he who gives life to every little Creature, and to thoſe innumerable Animals that are in the World; who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſo many thouſand Eſſences by a continual influx derived from himſelf, and has millions of Angels and other Souls, who live and move and have their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral beings in him: In a word, he who made and preſerves all things by a word of his mouth, and needs nothing but the mere willing of a thing to make it; how <hi>great is</hi> this <hi>our Lord and of great power; his underſtanding is inſinite,</hi> Pſal. 147.5. and he can do any thing that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes not a contradiction, nor is contrary to the reaſon and nature of things, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own other perfections of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Juſtice and Goodneſs, as I ſhall ſhow briefly the Reſurrection is not. 1. Then there is no incapacity in the ſubject, nor no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in the nature of the thing to make the Reſurrection incredible: A dead body is no more uncapable of life than a body at reſt is of motion, or than a torch put out is of being kindled again; and the ſoul may as well be united to it afterwards, as is was at firſt. It may be brought into it when raiſed from the Grave, by the ſame Laws of the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:60245:174"/>Univerſe, or the ſame vital Congruity by which it came into it, when it was firſt formed; and every ſoul may as well be directed to its own body then, as it was before: the greateſt difficulty in the ſubject is this, That the parts of the body are ſo ſcattered and divided in ſeveral places, and made the parts perhaps of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bodies, that its hard to conceive how they ſhould all come together and be united to their proper bodies; but tho' they are ſcattered they are not loſt; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Atom, be it never ſo ſmall, is ſtill to be found in the vaſt maſs of matter: and whatever alterations it may have paſt thro', yet has its being and ſubſiſtence ſome where in the World, and ſo may with Power and Wiſdom be put together again; like the many little pins and ſmall pieces of a great Machine, tho' they are all taken to pieces and miſplaced, yet they may all be ſet together again by a skilfull hand. Every part of matter is pervaded and fill'd with a ſpirit that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all its motions and knows the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteſt particles of it, and can range and order them as it pleaſeth, and there is nothing hid from the power thereof: There is not the leaſt appearance of a contradiction for a thing that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed or diſperſed to become the ſame it was before; it ſeems nothing ſo hard
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60245:174"/>as for a thing to be that was not before. So that the Reſurrection cannot be thought by any ſo incredible as the Creation, and he that is but a Theiſt and owns natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion, cannot with reaſon ſtick or boggle at this Article of Revelation, and he that believes an Almighty Power, could make all things out of nothing, need not doubt his power to make a thing what it was before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither is the Reſurrection contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to any certain principle of truth, which the God of truth has eſtabliſhed in the nature and reaſon of things; if it were, it could be no object of Divine power, for God's power muſt not deſtroy the truth of things; there are certain princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of truth and knowledge which muſt be kept inviolable, or elſe we run into boundleſs Scepticiſm, and can never know any thing to be true or falſe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt not call in the Almighty power to deſtroy thoſe, as the Papiſts do in Tranſubſtantiation, which muſt be as certainly falſe as we can know any thing to be certainly true; ſo that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infallibility can uphold it, nor infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite power effect it, without deſtroying thoſe certain principles by which we can know any thing to be true; by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the nature and properties of a body; by making the whole no greater
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60245:175"/>than a part; by taking away all evidence of ſenſe about its proper objects, and if we remove thoſe we have no way left to know whether any thing be true or falſe. But the Reſurrection is no way liable to any ſuch abſurdities, nor is it in the leaſt contrary to any certain and natural principles of truth; for then it would be not only incredible but abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely falſe, and impoſſible to be true: no Article of Chriſtian Faith is or can be ſo, but as we ſay, tho' it be above our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet is not againſt it. The bleſſed Trinity in Unity, tho' it be of another nature, of an infinite and incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble being, which may communicate it ſelf in ſuch a manner as we know not; yet however it be too big for our Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is not contradictory to any thing we certainly know to be true; and tho' it be an Idea by it ſelf it deſtroys none of thoſe Idea's we have of other things.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Reſurrection is no way inconſiſtent with any of the Divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections (which are the bounds alſo which the Divine power can never violate) is ſo plain, that it rather ſeems to follow and be fairly inferred from them; for what more agreeable to Gods goodneſs than as that he gave us our Souls at firſt, and put thoſe Souls into curious and well framed bodies, which are the other part
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:60245:175"/>of Humane Nature, which makes us to be Men and Beings of ſuch a rank and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Creation; ſo that he ſhould continue the ſame entire nature to us, as long as he is pleaſed to continue us in being. It wou'd be a charge methinks upon the Wiſdom of God, that he ſhould give Man ſo curious a body above any other Creatures, and yet ſuffer that to continue and laſt a much ſhorter time than the bodies of many other, not only A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals, but Plants and Trees do; if he did not deſign that this noble fabrick ſhould be rebuilt and repaired again af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death; and that the Soul ſhould have a longer term of aboad in it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and in reverſion, than it enjoys in this preſent life. It would ſeem ſtrange if theſe two Friends ſhould be ſo cloſely and intimately united here, but for a few days if they were not to meet again and dwell together for ever; and that God ſhould make us of ſuch a compound nature in this life, and of a quite other nature in the next, this would not be to keep that wiſe order and regular courſe of thing, that he does in the whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of the Creation. As to the Divine Juſtice, that ſeems to be more exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by raiſing the ſame bodies, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, we are hardly the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons) <hi>that every one may receive in his
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:60245:176"/>body according to that he has done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or bad,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. that not only the ſame Souls, but the ſame Bodies, which have either glorified God by Suffering or any other Vertue, or have been the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any ſin, ſhould be glorified or tormented in another World; and that the whole of Humane Nature, and not only a part of it, which the Soul is, ſhould be made capable of the everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments that are proper to it. The Reſurrection then is every way conſiſtent with the perfections of the Divine Nature, and is no way contrary to any natural principle of truth, nor implys any contradiction in it; and therefore is a proper object of God's Almighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and, by the help of that, may be eaſily effected and accounted for.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And without this power of God nothing elſe can be effected in nature; we muſt take in this, not only to give an account of the Reſurrection, but of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing elſe we ſee done before us, and of every effect and appearance in the viſible World: how we were made at firſt and how our bodies were formed, is as perfectly unaccountable without taking in the Divine Power and Wiſdom, as how we ſhall riſe again; and ſo is every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Myſtery of nature, if we well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:60245:176"/>it, and follow and trace it thro' all ſecond cauſes, it will neceſſarily bring us to the firſt; and we muſt reſolve all at laſt into the Power and Wiſdom of that. How we move our bodies by the thought of our minds, we know no more than how God ſhall raiſe them; what directs the ſpirits into ſuch Tracts and Muſcles, and by what pullies they draw up the heavy parts, is ſo admirable a Mechaniſm that it requires the ſame Divine Wiſdom as to raiſe the dead; how we live, how we think, and how we ſpeak, is to a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher as curious and as ſecret as how we ſhall riſe: every thing indeed is ſo in the Volume of Nature, which has the plaineſt Characters of Divine Power and Wiſdom every where writ upon it, as being to teach every one that there is a God. To look upward we ſee the Sun ſhines, but can we tell what light is, or how it ſtreams from the Sun to our Eye? how ſuch a maſs of ſire ſhould ſo long hold together without being quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched or leſſened? do we know how the Stars are ſixt to their Orbs? how thoſe gliſtering gemms are ſet and faſtned to the fluid firmament? can we imagine what Pillars there are, upon which the Earth is founded, and what it is ſupports the heavy Globe, and keeps it from ſinking? what it is that poizes, and makes it ſwim
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:60245:177"/>in the liquid Aether, and keeps it at ſo juſt and exact a diſtance from the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bodies, ſo as to be neither frozen nor burnt up? and can we be able to know what it is makes their motions ſo regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and harmonious, ſo uſefull and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the World? what guides their mighty bodies in ſuch even Tracts? what draws the crooked Zodiac for the Sun or Earth to move in? and keeps the violent and rapid matter from going on in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſtreight line, or ſome other way ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying and running out of order? Can any man, who juſtly conſiders theſe things, give any account of them without a wiſe God and Almighty Intelligence? not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Sparrow cannot fall to the ground without our Heavenly Father,</hi> as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpeaks, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.29. but not a ſtone can ſall thither, nor a ſpark fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, however neceſſary and natural that be, without, ſuch a frame and ſuch laws of matter and motion as nothing but a wiſe Being can eſtabliſh or cauſe to be obſerved. Why matter is thus figured and diſpoſed, and why ſuch effects come from it we cannot tell; as why graſs is green, blood red, and not the quite contrary: as we cannot of our ſelves make one hair white or black, as our Saviour ſaith, ſo neither can we tell why it is ſo; but every Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon muſt at laſt be reſolved into
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:60245:177"/>the Will and Wiſdom of the firſt cauſe, and thither all true Philoſophy muſt bring us; and the ſame Divine Power is requir'd in every the moſt common effect of Nature, as in the Reſurrection. But,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our not fully knowing the uſes and deſigns our bodies ſhall ſerve for after they are rais'd, ſhould not make the Reſurrection incredible to us: What uſe, ſome ſay will there be of the body in another World when the Soul alone is capable of the rewards of it? I anſwer who can tell but the body may be of extraordinary uſe to us in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother World? perhaps it is a neceſſary part of Humane Nature, and we are not our whole ſelves without it; perhaps the Soul is never to be quite naked and wholly ſtript of all matter and bodily indowment, and that it is cloathed with a thinner Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle when it puts off the thicker and groſſer fleſh: perhaps no Beings in the World but God himſelf are to be pure ſpirits, which was a very ancient opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome wiſe Men; perhaps the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves have material veſtures of a ſlaming fire, and a reſplendent bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as they uſed always to appear; and if the Human Souls are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloathed but <hi>cloathed upon with our houſe which is from Heaven,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. What more fit than that the materials of this houſe ſhould be taken out of its former
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:60245:178"/>body, tho' greatly improved and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as I ſhall ſhow immediately? who can tell what proper pleaſures God ſhall fit for our bodies, and make them ſuch noble Organs for the Soul as ſhall be migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty uſeful to it? and who knows whether that can enjoy all that alone without the body as with it, and that there is not ſome new faculty or ſatisfaction reſulting from its animating and being united to a body, the Scripture repreſenting the happineſs of the other ſtate not to be compleat till the general Reſurrection? God alone can tell what faculties and powers are fit for his Creatures in any ſtate; and while we are in this, we can know no more what is proper for us in the other, than an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo not yet born can conceive what it ſhall need when it comes into the world: were it not abſolutely neceſſary, yet it ſeems very agreeable to Juſtice, to have both the body and ſoul that were part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in Sin or Vertue, to be ſharers in the rewards of it. And if Chriſt the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation is to be perfect Man as well as perfect God in Heaven, and his glorious body is probably to be the viſible Shechinah of Heaven it ſelf; the bodies of all good Chriſtians ought to riſe and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him, and be partakers with him of the ſame Glory, that ſo human Nature even in its weakeſt and fraileſt part may eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:60245:178"/>triumph over death and the grave, and over him who had the power of both.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And Laſtly, To take off the incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Reſurrectionn, let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how far the body that is raiſed is to be the ſame with that which is buried and corrupted. We muſt not be too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous and exact in inſiſting upon the ſame body; if we be, we cannot be ſaid to have the ſame body two days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Our bodies are always in flow, and ſeveral parts of them are always going off by inſenſible Tranſpiration, and others come in the place of them; like a River, we call it the ſame, tho' its Water be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways running and paſſing away, and ſcarce any drop of it be exactly the ſame the next Tide: or as we call that the ſame flame of a Candle all the while it is burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which yet is waſted every moment and ſupplied with other new parts of oyl, ſo we have the ſame body in our old Age that we had in our Youth. And this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body of ours that was ſome time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated by our Souls, that this ſhall riſe again the Scripture is too plain to have it denied, as it is by the <hi>Socinians;</hi> the very word Reſurrection, ſuppoſes it to be in ſome ſenſe the ſame body; and they which riſe again are ſaid to be the ſame that were aſleep, and lay in their graves: ſo that if we had quite another new bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:60245:179"/>given us at the day of Judgment, this might be ſaid to be new made or crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not to riſe again. But yet it is not neceſſary that every part of matter which made up this Body of ours at our Death, and was buried in the ſame Grave, ſhould go to the making up of our rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bodies. It is ſufficient if this Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly body of ours which we had in this World, be the ſeed or ſeminal body as it were of the Reſurrection body, out of ſome part of which it is as truly raiſed, as the new Corn or Fruit is out of the Corn or Kernell which was ſet or ſowed; ſo the Apoſtle gives us an account of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.36, 37, 38. in anſwer to that queſtion, <hi>How are the dead raiſed up? or with what bodies do they come? i. e.</hi> how are thoſe whoſe parts have been ſo variouſly mixt with other bodies, and turned into the ſubſtance perhaps of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, whoſe very bodies are again to be raiſed, how ſhall every part of theſe men be raiſed up; when perhaps ſeveral men might have parts of the ſame body, and therefore in the Reſurrection whoſe body ſhall it be, ſince many had ſome of it to be their body? and with what bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall every one come, if it muſt be exactly the ſame, and yet that is ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard, if not ſome time impoſſible? To this the Apoſtle anſwers, <hi>Thou Fool,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:60245:179"/>that which thou ſoweſt, is not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned except it die: and that which thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not that body which ſhall be, but bare Grain, it may chance of Wheat or ſome other Grain: But God giveth it a body as it hath pleaſed him, and to every ſeed his own body:</hi> God does give every Man his own body, but not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame, as not to be at all alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but as a building is the ſame which is repaired, tho' with a great many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther materials; and as an ear of Corn is the ſame with its ſeed, tho' it has taken in a good quantity of the moiſture of the Earth, and turned it into its own body. Thoſe who have curiouſly examined the Anatomy of Plants and Seeds, tell us, that in the little Gemm or Eye of the Seed is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the whole draught and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Stamina</hi> of the Plant, with its bark and leaves, and fruit, and all the lines of it exactly drawn in little, which are after to be fill'd up and extended by the heat of the Sun, and moiſture of the Earth. And if ſo little a ſeed or kernel can contain all the parts of a large ſtalk or great tree, who knows how much of our preſent bodies may be ſufficient to raiſe the ſame bodies out of again? and how ſmall a part of this corruptible matter may be the Embryo, as it were, of our Heavenly bodies? It is certain theſe our
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:60245:180"/>bodies ſhall be ſo much altered, that that <hi>which is ſown in corruption, ſhall be raiſed in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption; and that which is now a natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhall be then a ſpiritual;</hi> not that it ſhall be turned into a ſpirit, and loſe its corporeal nature; but that it ſhall be refined and made pliable to the Soul and Spirit, and to all its motions, and ſtand in no need of thoſe things that belong to the animal life. And yet it may ſtill be the ſame body for all thoſe new modes and qualities, as a Jewel is the ſame ſubſtance of the Earth, which was once a common fluid, and is now turned into an Orient Pearl; and the moſt clear Cryſtal Glaſs is the ſame matter that was before Sand and Aſhes. The beſt Philoſophy tells us there is no ſpecifick difference in matter, but it is the ſame in ſubſtance, tho' its outward figure colour and other accidents be altered, which are but ſeveral modifications of the ſame matter; and I can conceive God as eaſily to change theſe our mortal corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible bodies, into immortal and incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ones, as he turns the ſubſtance that every Animal eats into blood and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; and the moiſture and filth of the Earth that nouriſhes every flower and fruit into the moſt beauteous colour and moſt delicate taſt. Cannot he give the Soul a ſhining and a glorious body even out of this corruptible one, as well as
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60245:180"/>he made the Sun and Stars and all thoſe luminous bodies out of the dark and gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Chaos? Cannot he make our bodies to ſhine as the Stars of glory, as well as the Stars themſelves, which, tho' Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodies, yet are of the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance with Earthly matter? Cannot he make our bodies which are now a clog and burden to the Soul, to be but like ſo many fiery Chariots to carry us up to Heaven? or like ſo many Wings to move us nimbly where-ever we pleaſe, and fleet us thro' all the Heavenly Regions that are above? Cannot he do this, as well as he has given Wings to the flame, and made that which ariſes out of ſmoak and foot to caſt forth rays and luſtre, and mount upwards? The glorified bodies of Men or Angels are generally in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture compared to flame and light, their <hi>countenance is</hi> then <hi>like lightning, and their raiment white as ſnow,</hi> as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel is deſcribed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.3. and, as our Saviour, when his body was transfigured <hi>his face did ſhine as the Sun, and his rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was white as the light,</hi> Mat. 17.2. and ſo ſhall the bodies of good Men after the Reſurrection, be turned into ſuch pure and glorious bodies, that they ſhall raiſe ſplendour and beauty all about them; which tho' it be a great tranſmutation, yet by many the like inſtances I have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:60245:181"/>is neither impoſſible nor incredible to conceive. The bodies indeed of wicked Men will be very much altered and loſe their animal and mortal nature, but they will be groſs and heavy and ſink their Souls into the regions of Hell and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they will be like ſo many diſmal and filthy Dungeons to keep the Soul in chains of everlaſting Darkneſs: or, like ſo many poiſoned ſhirts, like that of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> that will ſcorch and inflame and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture them beyond expreſſion, and ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſe to them burn them with poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous flames, and fill them with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſtench of ſire and brimſtone. How the bodies of wicked men may be made the Inſtruments of torment to their Souls, is eaſie to imagine from the exquiſite pains they often give them here; from whence we may conceive how they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to be the dreadfull racks of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death, where the miſerable wretches may be always ſuffering the pains of death without dying; and on which they may be made to lie for ever, raging and gnawing their Tongues for pain, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming the God of Heaven, becauſe of their pains and their ſores, to wit, of their bodies, as they are deſcribed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.10. And here I could ſtop, and offer one thought to thoſe who are ſo fond and tender of their bodies here, who are
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:60245:181"/>for indulging them in every Luſt and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Pleaſure, and think Happineſs lieth in the mere delights of the body; what they will think of having theſe pretious parts, theſe dear bodies thus eternally and exquiſitely tormented for the ſake of a few paulcry ſins which are but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but having defended and conſirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this article of our Chriſtian Faith, the Reſurrection of our bodies, I muſt name but one general uſe of it, and that is, Let us all of us ſo live as if we hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed it without making any the leaſt doubt in our minds about it; let no miſts of. Infidelity overcaſt this Faith of ours, which as it is certain by Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo is far you ſee from being incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by reaſon, which was the point I was to conſider and make out. It is a great ſatisfaction to eaſe our thoughts from ſome difficulties about it, and have the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as the eye, ſee things clearly without a film over it. But theſe articles of faith are not only for Contemplation and the Entertainment of our reaſon, but like Principles and Theorems in other Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, they are to be made uſe of in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and to be drawn out and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into uſe and action; no truth in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, no Article of Faith is worth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out or proving, or ſatisfying our ſelves about, if it be not ſome way or
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:60245:182"/>other uſefull to the practice of Religion, and be not influential to the making us good and vertuous in our lives: but the Reſurrection has ſuch a direct and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate tendency to do this, as it carries in it the aſſurance of a future ſtate both of Soul and Body, that if we fully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it and are undoubtedly perſwaded of it, it will do its own work, and will neceſſarily promote Vertue and Religion; and be effectual upon all our lives, did not a ſecret Scepticiſm and Inſidelity, which is the Vice of our Age hinder and defeat the power of it: Let the belief of it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be firm and unſhaken upon our minds, and let the efficacy of it be powerfull up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Lives and Converſations; there is nothing more incredible in the thing that our bodies ſhould riſe hereafter than that they were once formed and born: there may be difficulties perhaps equal in the account of both, but as no Man doubts the one, ſo he that well conſiders will have no reaſon to diſ-believe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to think it <hi>incredible that God ſhould raiſe the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let it raiſe us to thoughts and to things above, whither Chriſt is raiſed and where he ſits with his glorious body at God's right hand. Let us often aſcend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our minds now, whither we hope to aſcend hereafter with our bodies as
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:60245:182"/>well as our Souls: Let us conſider that theſe Bodies of ours, as well as our Souls, were made for higher deſigns and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enjoyments then any here of this World, and that they ought to be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Purity and Vertue now, as they are to be of Happineſs hereafter; The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection will raiſe our minds to a great many noble thoughts, if we throughly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it and really believe it, and I hope we may be ſatisfied by what has been ſaid.</p>

               <p>THE Author of this Epiſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes in this Chapter, thoſe Jewiſh Chriſtians he wrote to, to take care that they fell not into that ſad ſtate and temper of mind, their forefathers were in in the time of <hi>Moſes. Not to harden their heart: now as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderneſs,</hi> v. 8. when tho' they ſaw the mighty works of God forty years, and had daily Miracles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Eyes, and were fed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by them, and lived under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:60245:184"/>diſpenſation of them; yet ſtill a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Inſidelity and Obſtinacy was amongſt them, and their hearts were hardned and they would not hearken unto God, nor obey his voice; but were kept out of the good Land, by reaſon of their monſtrous and unreaſonable belief: ſo it was alſo in the times of our Saviour, when notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his many Miracles done before their Eyes, they were yet ſo blinded and hardned by their ſins, that they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Inſidels; ſo that the utmoſt, and one would think, irreſiſtible evidence could not prevail upon them. Human Nature is ſtill the ſame it was then, and liable to the ſame corruptions and depravations, and when it has ſuffered its Luſts and Vices, and unreaſonable Inclinations to grow upon it, and have power over it, they will quickly bring Men to a wretched blindneſs of mind and hardneſs of heart; ſo that the beſt evidence for Religion, and the ſtrongeſt arguments and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations for the Truth, or the practice of it ſhall not prevail upon 'em; but whilſt they indulge themſelves and continue in their ſins, this will corrupt their Minds and deprave their Faculties, darken their Underſtanding, and ſpoil their Judgment, bring them to hardneſs of heart and a reprobate mind, and to groſs and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Inſidelity, and at laſt to a total
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60245:184"/>defection and apoſtacy from all Religion: <hi>Take heed therefore,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Leſt there be in any of you an evill heart of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief in departing from the living God,</hi> v. 22. and the way to prevent that, was not to be drawn in by any ſin, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any Vice or Luſt that ſhould bring 'em to this; but to take a preſent and immediate care to free themſelves from every ſuch ſin, and to perſwade one another to keep cloſe to Religion, and not to give way to any Vice or Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs deluding them at firſt, or growing afterwards more upon them; <hi>Wherefore exhort one another daily while it is called to day, leſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> From theſe words I ſhall conſider theſe two things.</p>

                  <item>1. How ſin deceives at the beginning.</item>
                  <item>2. How it hardens the mind after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</item>
               </list>
               <p>How it firſt cheats and horribly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes upon us, and then how it brings the mind into a more wretched and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and hardned ſtate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Of the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> One would think that either Human Nature were not ſo rationall as we pretend it is, and that this were not our inſeperable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; or elſe that Vice were not ſo fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and unreaſonable, ſo pernicious and deſtructive as we ſuppoſe it to be; when
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:60245:185"/>we look into the ſtate of the World and ſee Vice every where prevailing and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding, and moſt Men chooſing and preferring it before Vertue; as Men are rational Creatures that act as from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Liberty and Judgment, ſo always from an inſtinct of ſelf good and ſelf preſervation which ſeems to be a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principle that prevents all reaſon, and which we can never with all our choice and freedom act wittingly and willingly againſt. We can never chooſe evil as evil, but under the colour and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of good; but our nature is made with an inward ſpring that runs of it ſelf from a naked evil, but always pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues what we apprehend is good for us, what appears to us, as conducing and tending to our Welfare and Happineſs; and therefore we muſt bring Religion and every thing elſe to this, if we would have it fall in with Nature, and be laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly and ſurely ſixt in our Minds.</p>
               <p>But either Vice is not ſo great an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, ſo deſtructive and contrary to the good Welfare and Happineſs of Humane Nature; or elſe our reaſon muſt be very much cheated and deluded, and impoſed upon, when we are drawn into it; and we muſt be mightily deceived by ſome falſe reaſoning or other about it in our own minds: for there is a ſort of reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:60245:185"/>and arguing, judging and concluding however ſhort and quick, and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate and miſtaken this be, in every moral action we do; and ſome proceſs there is in the mind and thoughts, even when we are led never ſo much by our ſenſes, and act not upon thoughts or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; elſe the action would not be Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary or Criminal, or capable either of guilt or blame, as proceeding from a miſuſe of our reaſon and choice, our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and fieedom.</p>
               <p>Our underſtanding and reaſon muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore judge amiſs and be groſly deceived and impoſed on, when, contrary to our good and intereſt, we are drawn into the practice of ſin, and ſeduced by its temptations, and inveigled by the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs of it; for tho' it be againſt our reaſon in one ſenſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> againſt the right uſe of it, yet it carries our reaſon along with it at that time we commit it; and our judgment determines for it at that inſtant, tho' very raſhly and unadviſedly, as we find when we come to conſider it over again. The deceitfulneſs of ſin lies therefore chieſly in theſe following things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In having too high an Opin on, Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Imagination of thoſe little Goods, Pleaſures, Profits, or whatever preſent ſenſual and worldly Enjoyments any of our ſins may yield to us, or that we can
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:60245:186"/>hope to reap by them. Theſe are the three Luſts the Apoſtle mentions, <hi>Of the Fleſh, of the Eye, and the pride of Life,</hi> or rather the objects of thoſe; theſe are the gilded bait, the fair fruit, the alluring charms and inviting temptations that draw in and inveigle every ſinner; for no Man would be wicked or ſerve the Devil for nought, nor commit any ſin out of pure malice to God and Religion, and mere hatred to Vertue; at leaſt not till he is arrived to a very high degree of diabolical wickedneſs. No, 'tis to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and attain ſome fancied good and imagined pleaſure or advantage; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing gratefull and deſirable to the ſenſes, Appetites and Inclinations of our nature, that tempts and allures us. Now there being a ſmall natural good in many of thoſe ſinfull temptations, for ſuch it muſt be allowed bodily pleaſure and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profit and other enjoyments are, which therefore good men may deſire and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of within ſuch bounds and limits as are allowed by God and Religion; and thoſe are even the bleſſings of God's left hand, as the <hi>Jews</hi> phraſed them; and it is an unnatural piece of Stoiciſm, and an Hypocritical affectation to renounce them wholly, and declaim weakly againſt them. Riches, and Honours, and Pleaſures, are Lawfull objects of our deſire in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:60245:186"/>and may have a proper good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to them ſuitable to our preſent ſtate and nature, and their contraries may be called evils; elſe it would be no Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to deny them, or forgo them in any caſe, nor would have any reward at God's hand; but they are not the great goods our nature was made for, nor thoſe that can make us truly and compleatly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, tho' we had never ſo many of them; nor are comparatively any goods, becauſe nothing ſo great as Wiſdom and Vertue, as Peace of Mind and Tranquility of Soul, as an inward Senſe of God's Favour, and chearfull hopes of Heaven; theſe will make a Man truly and inwardly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py without or with a very little of the other, and give him the true perfection and happineſs of his nature, and make him eternally bleſſed, when all others are periſhed and gone, and ſignifie no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>'Tis an ignorance of the true nature of good and evil in relation to our ſelves, as well as to the World, that is the prime and general cauſe of Mens being deceived into ſin; and the firſt part of its deceitfulneſs, is by the immoderate and ſalſe Opinion of thoſe little Goods or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Enjoyments we may obtain by them; Thus when our Fancies and vain Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations repreſent Riches and a great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:60245:187"/>as the greateſt Good, as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Security, Credit and Comfort, and what will afford and bring in all other good things of this World; this makes a Man make Riches his God, and put his truſt in 'em, and Sacrifice every thing to Mammon, and uſe any means to attain 'em, becauſe he thinks nothing ſo evil as to be without them, and nothing elſe ſo good as having abundance of them. So another fancies no happineſs like that of being Great and above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of having the knee and the head, and the outward marks and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſuperiority given him, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in State and Grandeur with a rich Train, and ſplendid Equipage always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending him; and he deſpiſes poor and contemptible Vertue in reſpect of all this, and thinks as meanly of the greateſt Wiſdom without thoſe, as that does of him; and therefore rather than part with thoſe, he will part with his Conſcience, and change his Religion rather than his place, and will ſtick at nothing either to keep or gain his ambitious Ends and Deſigns. Another who is a Voluptuary, and thinks Pleaſure the <hi>ſummum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> the chiefeſt good he can taſte or feel; he hunts after it thro' all the Scents and Paths of Senſuality, Luxury, Lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Debauchery, and either <hi>Bacchus</hi>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:60245:187"/>or <hi>Venus</hi> is the Deity he worſhips; and the greateſt Good and Enjoyment he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and imagines, and has an Idea of, is the Wine ſparkling in the Glaſs, or the Charms of Beauty, or the other objects of ſenſual Pleaſure: and by heating his thoughts and inflaming his fancy, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of thoſe things grow impatient, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive and ungovernable. Now if a man had uſed himſelf to conſider ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly how little there is in all thoſe things, how very little in reſpect of the greater pleaſures of a wiſe and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie Mind, a good Conſcience, and the hopes of Religion; and that all the true Pleaſures of Life, that are deſirable to a Wiſe Man, may be otherwiſe enjoyed within the bounds of Vertue; and that the going beyond thoſe is an unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſchief to himſelf and to the World; and that all thoſe little ſenſual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary goods he is ſo fond of, are at beſt but ſhort and tranſitory, empty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfying things, but poor triſling ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, and mere gilded decaying Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, that will all quickly periſh and paſs away, ſo that our proper happineſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie in them. This would give us ſuch true Opinions and right Apprehenſions of all carnal and Worldly things, in which the whole ſtrength and temptations of ſin are placed, as would diſarm and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:60245:188"/>it of all its power, ſtrip it of all its fine dreſs and falſe attire, waſh off all its paint, ſpoil all its beauty and ſhining lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre, whereby it impoſes upon our vain fancies and weak imaginations; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us with a falſe Opinion of thoſe ſmall Goods, Profits, or Pleaſures it can afford us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We do not at the ſame time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with thoſe the great evil that is in them, and ſo do not judge rightly and impartially on both ſides, but determine haſtily on one, and ſo are deceived; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to make a true Judgment and Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, we ſhould ſet the evil againſt the good, and ſo weigh the matter, and ſet the balance right between them; but, Alaſs! Men are in too much haſte to do this, when they are ſo hotly and eagerly purſuing their Luſts; when, having the fancied good Pleaſure and Enjoyment of their ſins only in their Eye, they never think or conſider, or take into their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts the much greater and more nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and more certain evils that belong to them, and are inſeparably annext to the commiſſion of them; if they did, no Man would ſwallow the thin bait when he ſaw the ſatal hook under it; None would eat the forbidden fruit, tho' never ſo fair and pleaſant to the Eye, if he knew and certainly believed that Death
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:60245:188"/>was its bittter ſauce, and in the day he eat thereof he ſhould die: No Man would drink the ſweeteſt draught, or take down the moſt delicious morſel, if he thought it would kill him. Nature without any great deliberation refuſes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and abhors what it apprehends to be evil, as it is extreamly fond and deſirous of what appears good and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to it; and the fear of the one is perhaps more ſtrong and affecting than the love of the other; as the ſenſe of pain is greater and quicker than that of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and therefore did it ſpy the Snake in the Graſs, the Serpent hid under the Bed of Roſes and Violets, it would not be invited by all their beauty and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to lie down upon them; and it would be quickly frighted and run from the tempter, tho' he appear'd as an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, if it ſaw his Cloven Foot. Vice therefore always uſes art to conceal its worſt ſide, hides its deformity and rottenneſs under a falſe paint and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit colour, and varniſhes over its real evil with the <hi>fucus</hi> of ſome ſeeming good; ſo the unwary ſinner is drawn into its deadly embraces with its meritricious Looks and falſe Charms. The veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſting lies covered under the ſweet hony, and the ſinner perceives not the Dagger of the Treacherous Aſſaſſin, till
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:60245:189"/>he is ſtabb'd with it to the heart. But a little Wiſdom and Obſervation, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about us, would plainly diſcern the innumerable evils that ſin carries in its bowels, and is big and productive of; which grow out of it, as fruit from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per root, and are inſeparably annexed to it as effects to their cauſes; that can no more be divorced or reſcinded from it, than light clipt from the Sun; and are unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terably ſetled upon it, by the nature and conſtitution of things, and the will, and appointment of the firſt cauſe and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of them. How do many not only ſhipwrack their Conſciences, but their Fortunes too by their Vices in this world, where we ſee abundance of thoſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Veſſels, who have ſplit themſelves upon Lazineſs or Luxury, Lewdneſs or Prodigality, or ſome other wickedneſs, by which they have ruined themſelves here, as well as hereafter? How have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers waſted their Bodies by the ſame courſes as they have done their Eſtates? And have ſinn'd particularly againſt thoſe as the Scripture ſpeaks, as well as againſt their Souls, and been a kind of Martyrs in the ſervice of the Devil, and their own Luſts, and endured more pains in their bodies to go to Hell, than other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs have done to go to Heaven? How do they whoſe hopes and deſigns are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:60245:189"/>in this Life, and who fear nothing ſo much as Death, and think nothing ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to live long; yet ſhorten their lives by their Vices, and by living as they call it too faſt, that is, running on in the full Career of wickedneſs, and galloping as hard as they can to Hell. How do they, I ſay, <hi>Not live out half their days?</hi> and they are ſometimes ſo haſty to die, that their bodies are often rotted before they come into their Graves, and their ſins in ſome meaſure prevent death. How have others ſtigmatized their names with their Vices, and brought a laſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and real infamy upon themſelves and families; where yet nothing has been ſo dear to them as titular Reputation, and the falſe Image and Idol of Honour? How have they madly Sacrificed their Souls and their Lives to redeem that, which yet they have baſely thrown away by a ſcandalous Life, which has made them baſe and contemptible to all wiſe Men? Thus, how plain is it that ſin, beſides the vaſt and amazing miſeries of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World, brings moſt of the evils of this upon us; A blot and reproach to our credit and good names, ſickneſs and diſeaſes to our bodies, and often beggery to our ſelves and families; and above all ſpoils and corrupts the Mind, takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Peace and Improvement of it,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:60245:190"/>fills it with inward diſcompoſure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs; and often ſo impairs a Mans reaſon and underſtanding as to leave the old and wretched ſinner only the ſhape of a Man, with the nature and qualities of a Beaſt. Now all theſe a blinded ſinner either ſees not, or conſiders not; either quite forgets, or does not at all mind in the hot purſuit of his Luſts, and the hurry and tumult of his unruly Appetites; he feels not the Wounds that are given him in his hot blood, tho' when he grows cool a little he will be very ſenſible of them; his thoughts are wholly taken up with the ſancied good and pleaſure, and he looks to nothing but that, nor conſiders the much greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils and miſchiefs of them; ſo he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues his Game and follows the Chaſe, and ſees not the pit or the precipice juſt before him, 'till he is faln into it; he leaps into certain danger without looking into it, and without any fear or foreſight, runs upon Death and Deſtruction, <hi>as the horſe ruſhes into the battle,</hi> as Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.6. An inward heat and ardor ſpurs him on, and he is wholly driven by other principles than thoſe of his reaſonable nature, and the ſerious thoughts and conſiderations of things, or obſerving the conſequences of his own Actions. And thus ſin deceives him, in the next place,</p>
               <pb n="339" facs="tcp:60245:190"/>
               <p n="3">3. By taking off his Mind from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering and examining things, or reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his own Actions, or uſing his own Thoughts; it makes him live on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the ſuggeſtions of ſenſe, and the propenſities of his animal nature and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er inclinations, without the Exerciſe or Government of his thoughts or reaſon, <hi>Like brute beaſts that have no underſtanding,</hi> as the Scripture compares ſinners, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 32.9. His Paſſions and Luſts, and irregular Appetites, grow maſterleſs and unruly, and get an intire Power and Dominion over him, and his reaſon has no check or controul over them; his Vices keep him always warm and heated, and never ſuffer him to cool or grow ſober, they ply him cloſe with what ſhall more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate and beſot him, and keep him from ever coming to himſelf; ſo his mind is always dozed, and he lives under a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual kind of drunkenneſs, and loſs of his reaſon: his thoughts are always drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Hurry, Buſineſs, or Company, Drink, Noiſe, or Diverſion; or ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſperſed in mad freaks and pranks of extravagance, and with a ſort of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical incoherent nonſenſe; or elſe amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Phantaſtick Whimſies and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantick Conceits, and imaginary Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of things, as they are drawn by Plays and Poets, contrary to all ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:60245:191"/>thinking, and the right knowledge of the nature of things, as God has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted them in the World. Thus it is with our either dull or witty unthinking Debauchees, who live a rambling, careleſs, thoughtleſs Life, without any true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, or any ſerious conſideration or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, and examining of things; who care as little as can be to think at all, and therefore avoid themſelves as much as may be, and never love to be alone; for nothing is ſo troubleſome and uneaſie to them as themſelves and their own thoughts, and therefore they keep from them all they can, and would be quite without them if they could: And upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count we find them often declaiming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon and thinking, and extolling the condition of Beaſts above Men, which is only another way of commending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, for at the ſame time they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to be as equal and like to them as may be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To ſhow the deceitfulneſs of ſin, we cannot but obſerve, that Vertue is much the likelier way to attain moſt of the preſent goods of this World, which ſin aims at, but generally loſes and deſtroys. Thus Sobriety, Chaſtity, and Temperance pick up that bodily pleaſure which is loſt and dropt by Vice and Debauchery, when they are ſo haſtily running after
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:60245:191"/>it; the ambitious and covetous miſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their aims, whilſt others unexpectedly meet with what they are in vain ſeeking; and generally moſt of the good things of this World, are by Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence ſettled upon Vertue, and loſt by Vice; the one <hi>is a Tree of Life,</hi> as the Wiſeman ſpeaks, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.18. and even literally <hi>Health to our Navel and Marrow to the Bones;</hi> while the other is a Diſeaſe and trouble to the Fleſh, and rottenneſs to the bones. The one is a Crown of honour that circles the head of the Wiſe and Vertuous, while the other is a foul ſtain and blemiſh to a mans Credit and good Name; the one is Peace and Joy and Gladneſs to the mind, the other is a worm to the Conſcience, a tormentor to the Soul, and an inward Hell in a Mans own breaſt. Wiſdom has <hi>in her right hand length of days, and in her left hand riches and honour; her ways are ways of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs, and all her paths are peace,</hi> as the Wiſeman long ago obſerved, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.17. whereas moſt of the temptations to ſin are Vain and Phantaſtick, Cheating and Deluſive, and have only appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but no real good in them; like <hi>Zeuxis</hi>'s Grapes, they are only painted artificially, but have no real ſweetneſs; they deceive the eye and the fancy at a diſtance, but there is nothing of true plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:60245:192"/>and delight to be taſted in them, but often a real bitterneſs inſtead of it, <hi>like the vines of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, Deut. 32.32. <hi>their grapes are grapes of gall, their cluſters are bitter, their wine is the poyſon of dragons and the cruel venom of Aſps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Men always find themſelves deceived and diſappointed in their vain expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of what their ſins will afford 'em, and therefore always come off with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, ſhame, and remorſe; and can never anſwer it to themſelves afterwards, nor find any good account in the reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when they come to caſt it up, and ask themſelves ſeriouſly the Apoſtle's queſtion, <hi>What fruit had ye in thoſe things whereof ye are now aſhamed?</hi> Rom. 6.21. <hi>They have walked after things that do not profit,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaks in another caſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.8. after mere Idols and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of good, pleaſure and profit, which they have found to be nothing in the World, and to have no reality in them. They have courted and embraced a mere airy empty Cloud inſtead of <hi>Juno,</hi> and been led by a mere meteor, an <hi>Ignis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus,</hi> a falſe light and ſeeming appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which has bewildred and miſguided them in their blind ſearch and dark pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit after their own good and happineſs. Where they have look'd for and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any good, they have always miſſed
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:60245:192"/>of it, and found the contrary evil; their ſins have been ſo hard and cruel to them, that when they have ask'd Bread, they have given them a ſtone, and inſtead of a fiſh a ſerpent; and their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is the beſt and only teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to them if they would attend to it, would learn 'em above all things the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Sin deceives very much with being cuſtomary and faſhionable; this draws in a great many by the power of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the having ſuch numbers and ſo great a party on its ſide; for thereby the ſhame and reproach of it is in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure took of, and the ſinner runs, he thinks, but the ſame riſque and venture with ſo many others, and hopes to fare as well as the reſt of his Companions and as others in the crowd. This is a ſtrong deluſion and works upon a great many, and is not ſo eaſily took off un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a great Authority, and a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample brings vertue into faſhion, as it eaſily may by having God and all good Men on its ſide; and ſo diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances Vice, and makes it become as infamous and contemptible in the thoughts of others, as it is in it ſelf: and when a mark of infamy is ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any thing, even upon the greateſt power or the greateſt ſin, it can never
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:60245:193"/>long hold its intereſt, nor keep its ground. Vertue can never loſe its Credit by all the attempts in the World, but will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be honoured, and have a true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and eſteem in the hearts of Men; and even thoſe who forſake it, will yet have an inward awe and ſecret reverence of it: but Vice, tho' it bears a mark like <hi>Cain</hi> of ſhame and ignominy upon it, yet when it becomes modiſh and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable, grows more bold and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and eſcapes a great deal of that reproach and diſgrace that belongs to it, and bears out with ſome conſidence and aſſurance, when otherwiſe it would ſneak and be covered with confuſion; then it endeavours as much as it can to run down ſolitary Vertue as a piece of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity and affectation, and to change the opinion of Men in thoſe things, and alter if it could the very nature of Vice and Vertue, and the thoughts and ſentiments of mankind about them; and make falſe Names, and counterfeit Terms of honour to it ſelf. But it may as well change the ſeaſons of the year, and turn Summer into Winter, and Day into Night, and pluck up the ſundamental Conſtitution of things, as deſtroy the fixt and immutable nature of good and evil; and as well pervert our ſenſes, or our perceptions of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made upon us by outward objects,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:60245:193"/>as the ſettled Judgment and Opinion of Mankind, concerning the moral objects of our mind. Nature, and Reaſon, and Wiſdom are ſtubborn and inflexible things, and will not comply with the modes and humours of a fooliſh World, and will be always on Vertue's ſide; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the mad men and the vitious may have the majority, yet they will never carry it againſt the other, nor be able to contend with them in a cauſe that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Nature, and Reaſon have decided and ſettled by a decree that is irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Health will be ſtill health, and is to be preferr'd to Pain and Diſeaſes, tho' in a general Contagion, and when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo many are ſick, and tho' the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes make them never ſo frantick and light-headed. Life was a thing very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable and comfortable to <hi>Noah,</hi> when all the World beſides periſhed; and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be never the leſs deſirable, nor Hell never the more tolerable, though there be few, as our Saviour ſays, that find the one, and many that go into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: ſo little is there in this deceitful Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to ſin, that it has numbers on its ſide, and is cuſtomary and faſhionable.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Sin deceives very often by being counted a little one, but a ſmall trifle and peccadillo in reſpect of thoſe greater and more ſcandalous Vices that bear a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:60245:194"/>mark and fouler Character. Thus to drop an Oath now and then, to take a Cup a little too much ſometimes, to ſet off Diſcourſe with a little Profaneneſs and Obſcenity, and to make bold with God and Religion for a Jeſt and a Witty ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to go as far in ſome Liberties as is poſſible without committing the laſt act of ſin; theſe and other things are called only innocent freedoms and ſuch as the ſociable and well bred, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons even of Conduct and Prudence can hardly avoid, if they would converſe in the World without the charge of too much preciſeneſs and moroſeneſs. But if theſe, however they are look'd on, are direct breaches of a Divine Law, if they are inconſiſtent with the known rules of Religion, if they are contrary to the Goſpel and the ſtrict commands of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; they are never to be called lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or ſmall ſins, but ſuch as a Man muſt avoid upon the peril of his Salvation, and being excluded out of Heaven: beſides, theſe leſſer unregarded ſins lead to others, and take off the ſtrict guard and ſerious watchfulneſs we ought always to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain over our ſelves; and lay us open ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often to the greateſt temptations, by carrying us to the utmoſt bounds of what is lawfull, and ſo to the neareſt approaches of what is ſinfull; and like ſmaller wounds
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:60245:194"/>and leſſer illneſſes by being over much ſlighted, and not taken care of, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in time dangerous and mortal.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for the deceits of ſin are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, and cannot all be reckoned up, tho' it concerns mankind above all things to know and eſcape them, and not be cheated in the main things wherein their happineſs or miſery conſiſts; but the laſt thing I ſhall name is this, That many Men are deceived into ſin by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may be eaſie to get rid of all the evil, and guilt, and puniſhment of it by the help of Repentance, and the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full proviſion of the Goſpel; by which they may quickly be ſet right again, and be in as good a ſtate as they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Now here are too many miſtakes to be conſider'd at preſent, I ſhall only ſay, that this is to be deceived not only in the nature of ſin, but in the nature of Repentance, and the nature of Religion, and to make that rather an incourager, and promoter of ſin than a deſtroyer of it, and to find out a trick, if it will do, even by the help of Religion it ſelf, to be too hard for Heaven upon its own Terms and Conceſſions; but God is not to be thus mocked or over-reached. No Repentance will do but what brings forth the fruits of obedience and a good life, nor is a ſin ſo eaſily repented of after it
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:60245:195"/>is committed, eſpecially upon ſuch preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous terms as may juſtly provoke God to give it up to an harden'd and impenitent heart, and to that wretched ſtate which ſin by being continued in will bring it to. Which is the next thing I am to conſider,</p>
               <p n="2">2. How Men are hardened by their ſins, or how ſin hardens their minds afterwards, and brings them to the moſt wretched and depraved ſtate and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And this I ſhall ſhow.</p>

               <p n="1">1. How Sin hardens in general. When a Man has given way to it in any great and willfull inſtances, and it has made a breach upon his purpoſes and reſolutions which were too weak to hold out againſt it, it will enter with all its force and gain ground daily upon him, and quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and overcome him, if he do not repulſe it immediately, and drive it out by Repentance: tho' he may a little ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and rally againſt it, eſpecially at the firſt beginning, when natural Conſcience will ſtrive a while with his carnal Luſts and Inclinations; yet if in this conflict the Sin prevails and is too hard for the Spirit, and he continues to commit it, it will at
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:60245:195"/>laſt wholly maſter him and bring him into ſuch Bondage and Vaſſallage, that he ſhall loſe the moral liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his mind, and be ſuch a ſlave to it as to be led Captive by it at its will; ſo that in the ſame ſenſe he both will not, and cannot get rid of it, for he has then loſt the power of his mind, and is brought under the perfect dominion of his Luſts and Vices: ſo that tho' he ſees the plaineſt miſchief of them, and wiſhes he could leave them, and would do ſo, if a faint wiſh and a mere velleity were ſufficient; yet he ſtill lives in them to the plaineſt ruin both of his Body and Soul, to his undoing both in this World and another; and tho' he ſees and ſeels the pernicious conſequences and effects of them, yet neither a decayed Body, nor a diſordered Mind, nor a ſhattered Eſtate, nor Conſcience, nor Credit, nor his own Reaſon, which condemns and reproaches him for them, can ever prevail upon him to forſake and abandon them.</p>
               <p>They have taken ſuch ſtrong hold of him, and he is ſo much under their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he cannot for all theſe ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and conſiderations reſiſt the next temptation or opportunity that invites to them; His Luſts and ſenſual Inclinations and diſorderly Appetites are grown ſo ſtrong, and his Reaſon and Religion
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:60245:196"/>ſo weak and unable to reſiſt them, that like a mighty Torrent, they carry all before them; and indeed he himſelf has broke down all the banks that ſhould withſtand them, and he is carried down by the violent ſtream of his Luſts, till it dryes up of it ſelf, and age, and infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty abate and ſink it, and his ſins, as we commonly ſay, leave him; and even then when he is dead to ſin in ſome ſenſe, yet the Ghoſts of his departed Vices ſtill haunt him, and the Phantoms or fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the Spirits (if I may ſo call them) of his Lewdneſs and Debauchery, ſtill hover over the Grave and the Carkaſs as it were of an old ſinner, and will not quite depart from him.</p>
               <p>This hardning of a ſinner is gradual, and comes not all at once upon him, but by the power of Cuſtom, and the ſtrength of Vitious Habits, he is brought by time and degrees to this hardned ſtate, and by an unaccountable quality in ſin it ſelf, whereby the mind is as it were pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified by it, and brought to that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which the Platoniſts often ſpeak of; ſuch a deadneſs and ſtupidneſs of its faculties, and its moral powers as we cannot well expreſs. Every ſin har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens the mind a little, and weakens the firſt tender ſenſe of good and evil that is natural to it; and the longer it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:60245:196"/>in it, it ſenſibly hardens it the more, tho' by ſecret and inſenſible means, as even Stones grow out of the Earth that was at firſt ſoft and fluid, but by time and a ſaline and other qualities they grow hard and rocky. A Sinner at firſt had great tenderneſs of mind, and could hardly be brought to commit a willfull Sin; 'till by Cuſtom and many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Acts, he grew more harden'd and embolden'd: So that what he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at firſt with reluctancy, he commits afterwards with greedineſs; the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and formation of Sin in his mind was by a ſmall ſeed or principle, and by an unaccountable growth and increaſe, a wicked thought became at firſt an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or rather a natural Inclination produced a Thought, a Thought increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Inclination, that begot a Delight, a Delight a Conſent, a Conſent an Act, an Act, by degrees, a Habit, and that becomes ſtronger and ſtronger by time; As in the growth of our bodies Anatomiſts tell us a Gelly becomes a Nerve, a Fibre, a Tendon, a Muſcle or a Bone, by ſtrange and imperceptible ways. The Body of Sin, which the Scripture ſpeaks of, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by cuſtom, and grows ſtill more and more, and has no fixt ſtature ſet to it, but is harder to be put off the older it is, and gets ſtrength every day, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:60245:197"/>it by age: The Sin which at firſt might have been eaſily withſtood and overcome, and like a young Weed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily pluck'd up; afterwards takes ſuch deep root in a Man's mind that 'tis the hardeſt thing in the World to remove it, and to get rid of a long and confirmed habit, that has been a great while grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us.</p>
               <p>This hardning of the Mind by Sin I take to proceed from Cuſtom, which has an unaccountable force and power upon us; and does as it were bend the Will that way, and put ſo ſtrong a byaſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Thoughts and Inclinations of the Mind, that it can hardly with all its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Liberty and God's ordinary Grace, get off of it; and when the Will is thus obſtinately bent to any Luſt or Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, it affects and draws in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and corrupts the Judgment; and the mind at the ſame time, it is thus hardned by its Vices, is blinded alſo by them: and ſo the two great powers and faculties of the Soul are corrupted by it both at once; for hardning reſpects pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Will, and blinding the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and they always go together, and are promiſcuouſly mention'd, the one for the other in Scripture. Mens Luſts and Vices as they harden them, and bring as it were a <hi>Callus</hi> upon the mind by
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:60245:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>long uſe and make it to be <hi>paſt feeling,</hi> as Scripture ſpeaks, ſo they darken and blind the Underſtanding, which is as it were the Eye of the Soul, and bring a cloud over it, or caſt a miſt before it, and hinder it from ſeeing and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things as it ought to do. Theſe, I confeſs, are all figurative expreſſions, whereby we are forc'd to deſcribe and illuſtrate the Acts and Operations of the Mind, by material and bodily reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances, as the Holy Ghoſt it ſelf does: But there are ſuch real effects in the Mind as anſwer to them, and about which we can uſe no other Words or Ideas. Mens Sins at the ſame time they harden their Wills, and bring them to a ſenſeleſsneſs and ſtupidity about their moral Actions, they blind their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo, and bring them to a Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſenſe, ſo as not to ſee the plaineſt Truths or greateſt Evidence, nor be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of the groſſeſt and moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Errors, nor be convinced by the ſtrongeſt Arguments and Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Truth or Practice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>

And this is done firſt of all by breaking thro' natural ſhame, and the innate modeſty of our minds; this is one of the ſtrongeſt ſences which God and Nature have ſet about Vertue, and the greateſt check and reſtraint againſt Vice; for it ariſes from the firſt quick and diſcerning ſenſe of the mind, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it ſees the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:60245:198"/>a Pander in time to all Vice and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sin hardens by ſtupifying Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and deadning the inward and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſe of good and evil on our Minds ſo as to bring Men by degrees to Sin without ſtruggle, diſpute, or reluctancy. It muſt be a great while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it comes to this, and a man muſt have gone thro' a long courſe before he can arrive at this ſtate and perfection of Sinning. No Man can commit a plain and great Sin at firſt without great ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and remorſe of mind, and great reluctance and oppoſition from his own Conſcience; the ſpirit will ſtrive againſt the fleſh, as <hi>the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, Gal.</hi> 5.17. there being a natural principle of Vertue in us as well as of Vice. And as a good Man muſt have many conflicts with his lower inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before he can arrive at a full ſtate of Vertue; ſo muſt a bad Man have as great a conteſt with his Conſcience and the natural ſenſe of his own Mind before he can be perfectly wicked. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience will check and reſtrain him at firſt, and inwardly ſmite and reprove him for doing amiſs, and this is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident proof of the natural difference
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:60245:199"/>between good and evil, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Monitor ſet up by God in every Mans breaſt to mind him of his duty, and the great ſecurity indeed of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but when Men have, by many acts and long cuſtoms of wickedneſs, waſted and ſinned away Conſcience, and ſtifled or ſtupiſied the inward ſenſe of their own minds, ſo as to ſin with greater eaſe, and without any trouble or oppoſition from within, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes or reſiſtances, or remorſes of their own Conſciences for whatever they do; then they are become perfect Sinners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and come to an abſolute and full ſtate of Wickedneſs, to be hardned into an utter inſenſibility, ſo <hi>as to be paſt feeling,</hi> and to have <hi>their Conſcience,</hi> as it were, <hi>ſeared with a hot iron,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. ſo as to be quite ſenſeleſs. This ſenſeleſsneſs may ſeem an eaſier and leſs painfull ſtate, but it is more mortal and dangerous; and is juſt ſuch a Diſeaſe to the Soul, as an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy or a Lethargy is to the body. If this ſenſeleſsneſs and ſtupidity would always laſt, it were much better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed than ſharp and actual pain, but the Conſcience of a Sinner, tho' it may ſleep and ſlumber a while, yet it will awake one time or other, and like
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:60245:199"/>an enraged Lyon tear and devour all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; Either Death or Sickneſs, or ſome Judgment or Affliction will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably rowſe it here, and bring the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pify'd mind to it ſelf; or to be ſure the flames of Hell will make it open its Eyes when it is too late, when it can ſee nothing but horror and deſpair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, and round about it, and where it; Conſcience ſhall always torment it with a Worm that never dieth, and with never ceaſing Anguiſh and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third inſtance and degree of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus hardned by Sin, is doubting of the Truth of Religion, and calling into queſtion the principles of it, and at laſt an utter rejecting and diſ-believing of them. No Man ever did this till he was corrupted in his morals, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in a vitious courſe; ſo that this Scepticiſm and Infidelity, was plainly the effect and conſequent of his Vices; and proceeded from his Will, blinded with his Sins and Luſts, rather than from his Underſtanding, or from any want of Evidence about thoſe matters. It was firſt the Sinners wiſh and deſire that there were no God, before he que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion'd whither there was one or no;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:60245:200"/>and he never doubted of the truth of another World, till it was againſt his Intereſt, and he was loſt and undone, if there were one, and therefore he was very unwilling to believe it. Men muſt have very much blinded their Minds, if they do not ſee the plaineſt Evidence for Religion, both from Nature and Reaſon, and from Hiſtory and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; from the make and frame of the World, and from the make of their own bodies, and the inward ſenſe of their own Minds: all which make it as unreaſonable almoſt to doubt of the Being of a God, as to doubt of their own being and exiſtence; and we may as well be Scepticks to the truth of any thing elſe, as to the truth of Religion.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There is a degree yet beyond this, and that is ridiculing Religion, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to Contempt and Laughter; which is not only the utmoſt and moſt deſperate attempt and affront againſt God, but the moſt rude and unmanner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as well as miſchievous thing to all Mankind; for all ſober and wiſe Men, and civiliz'd Nations, have always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there is a God, and 'tis no ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry civil thing to call them all Fools or Cheats for doing ſo; 'tis ſo much the intereſt, nay the neceſſity of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:60245:200"/>that there ſhould be one, that all Government, all Security, all Society, and living happily in the World, muſt be loſt without it; to laugh therefore at this, as either a Politick Cheat or a Melancholy Deluſion, on which ſo much depends, both as to the benefit of the publick, and the happineſs and comfort of all private Men, is only to ſhow the boldeſt folly and ill-will, both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and, without any reaſon in the World, to take upon themſelves to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade mankind that they are deceived in the moſt uſefull and neceſſary thing to 'em that can be. 'Tis certainly the higheſt impudence and rudeneſs to run down thoſe things, and expoſe them as ridiculous, which have been the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt objects of Honour and Reverence to all wiſe men; and to treat Religion and things Sacred, with jeſt and drollery, about which all the World has been the moſt ſerious and in earneſt; and to mock and ſcoff at that which others bow down to and tremble at. This is only a more mad and daring bravery in wickedneſs, and one of the higheſt inſtances of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and hardned Mind. I ſhall add but another, which is an effect as it were of this; and that is,</p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:60245:201"/>
               <p n="5">5. An induſtrious deſign of being wicked and glorying in it; to make it their buſineſs to ſpread and promote it, and to take pleaſure not only in committing Sin themſelves, but likewiſe in thoſe that do it. This is to love Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Wickedneſs ſake, and out of pure oppoſition to Vertue, and a direct enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Religion; When Men make it their Trade and a kind of Profeſs'd Science to be Debauch'd, and ſet down rules to themſelves and others of being ſo; When they can boaſt of their Wickedneſs, and glory in it; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume perhaps more to themſelves than they have been guilty of, and charge themſelves with ſuch Sins as they never committed, thereby to Triumph as it were in their mighty deeds and great exploits; and, to endear themſelves the more to their Lewd Companions, when they endeavour to out-do one another, and out-vye their fellow Sinners in Oaths, Drinking, and Debauchery; and give greater proofs of their higheſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in Wickedneſs and Lewdneſs. This is perfectly giving up themſelves to the Devil's Service, and to toil and drudge in it, as his greateſt Slaves, and as his Diſciples to devote themſelves to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:60245:201"/>him, and become ſworn votaries to Hell and Wickedneſs, and declare themſelves Champions and Defenders of his cauſe and intereſt, againſt God and Religion. 'Tis ſtrange that Human Nature ſhould be depraved and corrupted to theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but we ſee too many Examples of it in the World; and we ſee too what is the cauſe of it; namely, men's being ſo ſtrangely hardned and blinded by their Sins, and having their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Underſtanding and all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of their Minds ſo horribly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and depraved by them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From what has been ſaid, I ſhall make the following Remarks and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I obſerve from hence, That our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and trueſt happineſs lies in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and Improvement of of our Minds; and therefore we ought to take the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt care of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Vice is the greateſt Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Depravation of the Mind; and therefore we ſhould not ſuffer that to grow upon us.</p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:60245:202"/>
               <p n="3">3. I ſhall enquire into the Scripture-notion of God's hardning Men, and whether that be any thing more than our Sins hardning us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From hence we may conceive and underſtand the miſery and wretched ſtate of the Devils and damn'd Souls, who are come to the higheſt degree of this hardning.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I obſerve that our proper and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt happineſs lies in the Perfection and Improvement of our Minds.</p>
               <p>The happineſs of any Being muſt be ſuited and adapted to its Capacity and Faculties; for otherwiſe it has no root to grow upon, and the more thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities are enlarged and extended, and have agreeable objects to fill and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain 'em, the greater is the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. The loweſt Creatures that have ſenſe, have very ſmall Capacities, and their Enjoyments are very little; the more we riſe in the ſcale of Beings, the Capacities are greater till we come to the All-perfect Being; We have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Capacities, the ſame with the Brutes, which can partake of ſuch bodily plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as they do; but theſe are very
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:60245:202"/>little and narrow, and confined to few things, and a ſhort time. We have much higher Capacities even like God himſelf, whereby we take in all the truth that can be known, and all the good that can be enjoyed; and hoard up theſe immortal Treaſures in our Minds, and in the fulleſt meaſure of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts our proper happineſs as we are Men, and Rational, and Immortal Beings. 'Tis in our Souls, thoſe nobleſt parts of us, that our Happineſs lies and will lie for ever; Our bodies are poor dying de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying matter, that can afford very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Enjoyments, and for a very little while; the capacities of the mind are great and large, and comprehenſive, and can reach not only to all things that are made, but even to the God that made them, and partake of a proper happineſs from all of them; for the more it increaſes its knowledge, and grows up to a more perfect Underſtanding, and to a more free choice and entire willing of what is good; and the more good it enjoys, and the more its faculties are enlarged and filled up with their proper objects, the more Happineſs and Perfection, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Enjoyment it muſt have; and this will be its Eternal Heaven when we ſhall be as like God as we can be,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:60245:203"/>and equal to the Angels in the proper perfections of our rational nature ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the higheſt degrees, and the moſt unſpeakable Enjoyments and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Vice is the greateſt Corruption and Depravation of the Mind, and therefore is our greateſt miſery; it ſinks and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs the Faculties, decays and weakens the Mind, as a Diſeaſe does the body, and fills it generally like that with pain and uneaſineſs; as being contrary to its natural frame, and to its proper and regular Operations. Vertue is the Vigor and Health, the Soundneſs and right Conſtitution of the Soul, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life which Religion and God's Grace would advance it to; but Vice and Wickedneſs are the Spiritual death of it, both in the Language of the Scripture, and of the beſt Philoſophers of Old; their manner and cuſtom of ſetting a Coffin in the place of him that had left the Schools and Precepts of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, was ſpeaking the ſame thing in emblem and figure with the Scripture expreſſion of being <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins;</hi> The loſs of the Soul is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accounted ſo great an one, as the gain of the whole World will not
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:60245:203"/>compenſate; <hi>What ſhall it profit a Man,</hi> ſays our Saviour, <hi>to gain the whole world and loſe his own Soul?</hi> Matth. 16.26. Now the Soul can never be ſo loſt as to loſe its Being or its Power of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Happy would it be for a great many if it could ſo loſe it ſelf, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh into air or nothing: but 'tis the loſs of its proper Life and Happineſs of the right uſe of its noble Powers and Faculties, and of thoſe Operations and Enjoyments it was made for; and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Miſery and Anguiſh which its own thoughts bring upon it; This is the unvaluable loſs of the Soul, and a great part of its Hell, as I ſhall ſhow immediately.</p>
               <p>Sin indeed brings the Mind to this loſt and wretched condition by degrees; it darkens and blinds the Mind, and ſpoils its powers of rightly Judging and Underſtanding; not in an inſtant, but as darkneſs comes upon the Earth by gradual approaches. 'Tis hard perhaps to give a full Account how it does this; but it employs the thoughts upon wrong and undue objects; it immerſes and ſinks 'em in carnal Fancies and ſenſual Ideas; it perverts and diſtorts the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and gives it undue repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:60245:204"/>of things; or it takes it off from thinking and conſidering at all; by ſuch means it brings it to this paſs, tho' it <hi>have eyes to ſee, yet it ſees not,</hi> tho' it have Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that is, the natural power of it, yet it underſtands not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.14. ſo tho' it have its power of willing, yet it wills only evil, and has no moral ability to will good from the ſtrong prevalency of its own evil deſires and affections. This is loſing the Soul, and the right powers of it, and making it like an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorpt Star, loſe its proper light, center, and motion, tho' it be ſtill a Star but fallen, dark and wandring.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And this I take in the third place to be the Scripture-notion of hardning, when Men's ſins bring 'em to this ſtate; and when God is ſaid to harden them, 'tis not by any poſitive influx or poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous infuſion; nor yet perhaps by withdrawing his ordinary Grace, and the means of converſion from them: this he did not from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> or the <hi>Jews,</hi> or any other Sinners that we know of. 'Tis only Sin that hardens them, and their own Luſts and Vices that blind them; and when God is ſaid to do it, 'tis generally by doing ſuch things as are the occaſion, not the cauſe of it;
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:60245:204"/>which are in themſelves proper means of working quite other effects upon them, not of hardning and blinding, but rather of converting and convincing them: Such were all the Miracles God wrought and all the Methods he uſed, both with the <hi>Jews</hi> and with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> where he tried all ways to bring them off from their Obſtinacy and Infidelity, and continued ſo to do, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their abuſe of them. God ſtrikes no Man ſpiritually blind, nor takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way that light which is neceſſary for him to ſee by; or that ſtrength and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which is neceſſary to convert him. 'Tis the Clouds only darken the Earth, and not the Sun; 'tis the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the dark body of the one, and not the withdrawing the beams of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which properly brings night up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it. I very much queſtion whether there be any other judicial hardneſs and blindneſs, eſpecially in this Life, than what Mens ſins bring upon them; their being left to the malignant Power and efficacy of thoſe, is without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther influence or cauſality, the entire reaſon of their hardneſs and blindneſs; and God is ſaid to leave them and give them up to hardneſs of heart, juſt as a Phyſician leaves his Patient to the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:60245:205"/>incurable malignity of his Diſtemper, without either giving him any thing to encreaſe it, or without withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Application of any proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies that might help to cure it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Fourthly and Laſtly, By this we may conceive and underſtand the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and wretched ſtate of the Devils and damned Souls, who are under the utmoſt and irreverſible ſtate of this hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and depraved temper of Soul; which will naturally and neceſſarily make them miſerable. Thoſe accurſed Spirits were once capable of noble plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and improvements of mind; but Sin and Diſobedience to God, has ſpoil'd, and ſunk, and corrupted them, and brought them to this wretched condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where their thoughts are filled on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with rage and malice againſt God, and with an extream horror and dread of him, joyned with as great rage and vexation againſt themſelves. 'Tis a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing for a poor Creature willful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to offend and ſin againſt its Great God; impudently to affront and defie its Maker, and trample upon his Laws and Government; which is ſetting up its own Will, Thoughts, and Reaſon, againſt his. This will bring it to dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:60245:205"/>Thoughts and Reſentments one day, whatever we think of it, or however we ſlight it now. Sin would not have had a Hell and Eternal torments pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it by a good God, had it not been an oppoſition to the Will and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of Heaven, to all God's deſigns in making Us, and making the World; and contrary to all the meaſures of God's Wiſdom and Government, and to the Good and Welfare of the whole Syſtem of Beings. Vice therefore by the order of things, throws Men into this miſerable ſtate; and a lower ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by having its Thoughts, its Will, and Underſtanding, ſo contrary and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the higheſt ſpirit, and by not having due regards and obſervances to him, muſt neceſſarily fall into this ſtate of Miſery, as well as of his utmoſt Wrath and Diſpleaſure. It's Vices have depraved and corrupted its mind, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it wrong Thoughts of God, and of every thing elſe; and ſunk it into the love of evil, and of every thing contrary to God and Goodneſs; made it delight in miſchief, and in doing ſuch things as are directly contrary to the good of its fellow Creatures, if it were but a little gratifying to it ſelf. And now that falſe pleaſure is gone off, and
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:60245:206"/>it is left wholly to the ſting of its Vices, and it therefore reflects with infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe upon the folly, and the madneſs, and the miſchief of them; but it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now redreſs or amend them, or what injury it has done by them; and therefore it muſt lie for ever under the inſupportable weight and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of them. It cannot now raiſe up its thoughts to any love or deſire of God, whom it has always had a fix'd contempt and neglect of; it cannot now take any delight in him, or the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of him whom it ſeldom or ever thought of, or ever car'd to Worſhip or Acknowledge before; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now to divert or entertain it, its bodily Pleaſures and worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are gone off, and not here to be met with; and it is left wholly to its own uncomfortable thoughts, and to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream anguiſh and bitterneſs of them. It never rightly underſtood nor loved either God or Goodneſs; and now there is nothing elſe to be loved; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt hate it ſelf and every thing elſe: It muſt now bear the miſery of its own ill mind, which it has been ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and corrupting all its Life, and bringing to this fad ſtate and condition; and now it is deſperate and irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:60245:206"/>and becauſe it has loſt the only op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of improving and ſitting it for happineſs, it muſt now neceſſarily be miſerable with it as long as its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration laſts, that is for ever.</p>
               <q>God grant that we may avoid all thoſe ſins which will thus ſpoil our minds, and bring this hardneſs, and this miſery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us.</q>
